 Okay, everyone. ¶From now on, the SOS Squad will work together as one ¶ to hone our mahjong skills! 
 (Good. Suzumiya-san's positive. ¶This means we don't have to worry about a closed space.)
 ............
 Hm? What's the matter, Nagato. ¶You've been quiet since a while ago.
 ¶I thought mahjong was easy to win ¶ if you calculated the odds. ¶Yet I lost. ......
 ¶There are some factors in mahjong, like pulls and readings, that can't be calculated by ¶probability alone.
 Pulling ...... reading ...... interesting.
 Nagato's eyes lit up!  ¶...... something bad.
 ...... keep this world going for a while. ¶I want to get better at mahjong. ¶This world is a good place for that.
 Wow, I have a bad feeling about this.
 Don't worry. ¶This level of information alteration can be quickly corrected.
 You sure you believe that? ¶I mean, I have to believe it. ......
 Hey, you guys. What are you talking about?
 Uh, no. ¶I was asking Nagato-san about the secret to getting good at mahjong.
 Hmm. By the way, you remember our deal, right? ¶Billie's gonna clean up and take out the trash.
 I remember.
 Well, Kyung. ¶clean up and go home. ¶Let's go, guys.
 ¶Let's go, guys. ¶Even though you lost the game, you're too miserable to stay and clean by yourself. ......
 Damn, this is what happens when Haruhi says there's gonna be a mahjong boom!  ¶No, wait, is it my fault for losing the game?
 No, no!  ¶Haruhi's the one who said we had to clean up, ¶Haruhi's the one who's to blame! 
 But even if I hadn't lost, ¶if Nagato and Asahina-san had been the last to go,
 ¶would I have been able to sit idly by and let them stay behind to clean up?
 'Do you need any help?' ¶I wonder if I would have ended up cleaning up after all?
 If that's the case, it was already decided before we started playing mahjong that I was going to clean up. ......
 Whoa whoa whoa!  ¶I don't get it! 
 ............
 Ha! 
 Kyou, Kyon-kun's broken. ......
 Asahina-san!  ¶Do, do, why ......! 
 I was trying to help you. ...... ¶But Kyon-kun's broken. ......
 Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! 
 Hey Kyon!  ¶What did you do to Mikuru-chan?
 No, no!  It's a misunderstanding!  I didn't do anything ......
You're disgusting!  ¶You're not just a lousy mahjong player, you're a lousy human being! 
 Whoa!  I don't know what's going on, but ¶You're the worst anyway! 
 MARK4_1
 All right, top! 
 What's with the 'Yo, you're on top'? ¶Don't grin just because you won once! 
 Oh, Haruhi-kun. ¶Were you going to show us who's strong in the SOS Squad, ¶weren't you?
 I was holding back. ¶If we were serious, you'd be beat to a pulp! 
 You're a textbook sore loser. ......
 Kyung-kun, you were so strong. ¶You were so cool.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 Mikuru-chan. Don't be fooled. ¶Kyung just happened to win!  ¶It's not a matter of skill! 
 Come on, just admit that I won! 
 But still, if I'm going to be beaten by someone like Kyon, ¶I'm not ready yet. ¶I have to train harder.
 Okay, everyone. From now on, the SOS Squad will work as one to improve our mahjong skills!

 Okay, well, I guess we should call it a day, then.
 Wait a minute. I thought you Billi people were supposed to be ¶cleaning up and taking out the trash?
 Oh, oh, my God, what are you talking about?
 ¶I told you when you were bili, ¶I said I'd do it right. ¶You can't say I forgot! 
 I forgot! 
 Wha! 
 Come on, let's go home!  ¶I'll start playing mahjong tomorrow!

 Roger that.
 Now, leave the rest to Yuki and let's go home.
 Well then, Nagato-san, we'll leave you to it now. ......
 Excuse me first.
 Shall I help too, Nagato?
 Don't worry. I don't mind cleaning.
 I see. ...... ¶By the way, Nagato. Are you sure you don't want to fix the current situation?
 No. Mahjong is deep. ¶It's worth studying. Next time, I won't lose.
 Ooh, the long gate is quietly burning!  ¶I saw something amazing!

 Okay.
 I'd really like to take over for you, but ¶I'll be very mindful! 
 That's right, Kyon. ¶You should take over! 
 Why the hell not? ¶I'm the top! 
 Don't you feel sorry for Mikuru, huh?
 No, no, it's... ¶I do feel sorry for her. ......
 Then it's settled. ¶Mikuru, let's leave this to Kyung and go home! 
 But, but ......
 You have no objection to Kyon, right?
 Oh, it's for Asahina-san's sake. ¶I'll take care of it! 
 That's settled. ¶Let's go, Mikuru-chan.
 Uh-huh. ¶Thank you, Kyon-kun.
 Well, we'll see you at ......
 After you. ......
 Damn, I knew this was gonna happen. ¶Oh, oh, oh, I hate mahjong! 
 No, there's nothing wrong with mahjong. ...... ¶What am I gonna do with myself, man?
 MARK01_00_00
 Lorne!  ¶You fell for it, Furuizumi-kun! 
 No~, as expected of Suzumiya-san. ¶Well done.
 You know, Furuizumi. ¶You're transferring too much to Haruhi. ¶Sometimes you have to transfer to us too.
 Excuse me. ¶It's as if I'm drawn to Suzumiya-san's winning tiles. ......
 ( ¶ I hope you're not swinging in on purpose so Haruhi won't be unhappy. ......)
 Kyon!  ¶ Don't blame Furuizumi-kun just because your luck isn't good enough! 
 Come on, it's the last round next time. ¶We're going to get away with this~.
 Tea's ready, everyone! 
 Thank you, Mikuru. I'll be right up, just wait a bit longer.
 No. ¶I'll be watching, so you guys have fun~.
 What are you talking about? ¶SOS team unite to hone our mahjong skills. ¶You can't just skip out.
 Hey, fellas, how are you doing?
 Ah, Tsuruya-san.
Oh, you play mahjong? ¶As expected, you're a boom-bimbo.
 That's not true, Tsuruya-san. ¶I saw the mahjong boom coming before anyone else did.
 ¶The SOS Squad started working on mahjong earlier than the boom! 
 I see!  ¶As expected of you, Haru-nyan. You have a keen eye.
 ¶Suzumiya-san has foresight, just as Tsuruya-san said.
 Until now, mahjong had a strong image of being a game for adult men,
 But now mahjong has become the most popular game that can be enjoyed by men and women of all ages.
 Even in our class, we all play mahjong during lunchtime without eating.
 ¶The TV also has more and more programmes like the celebrities' Mahjong championship!  ¶The next Monday 9 is supposed to be a mahjong romance drama.
 ¶There are a lot of mahjong magazines in convenience stores, like Mahjong Ace and Mahjong Walker.
 (Blatant explanatory lines continue, but ¶ I'll close my eyes here. ......)
 Kyung. That dora, Ron! 
 Sheesh!  ¶I was distracted by the explanatory lines, ¶I accidentally cut the dora! 
 Tan-yao three-coloured dora 3 ...... honeymoon!  ¶I'm now the clear leader! 
 ¶That's it!  ¶And once again, Haruhi's got me. ......
 ¶I'm up to third place with a direct hit now, aren't I? ¶Thanks for saving me.
 Upside down, huh? That sucks. ......
 You still need more training, Kyon. ¶Then, Mikuru-chan. ¶Switch with Yuki, who's in second place, and let's play against each other.
 Yes, okay! 
 Hm? Is that sound ......?
 Hyah, that's embarrassing. ¶It's the sound of my stomach. ......
 Hey, Mikuru!  ¶You haven't eaten properly, have you? ¶No way, for tomorrow's physical ......
 ¶I'm going on a diet, one meal a day ......
 ¶IfI do that and lose a kilo or two, it won't add up to anything! 
 But, but ......
 What if you destroy your body due to lack of nutrition?
 That's right, Asahina-san. ¶Asahina-san isn't fat. ¶There's no need to diet! 
 Oh, thank you, Kyon-kun. ......
 Haru-nyan. I'm sorry, but ¶I'm taking Mikuru home today.
 I'm going to bury her in our yard and pour food into her mouth! 
 Is Asahina-san a goose?
 Come on, come here. Mikuru! 
 I understand.
 Mikuru-chan, you've been on an impossible diet. ¶I know it's embarrassing if you've gained weight, but ¶an unhealthy diet is not good.
 No dialogue.
 You think so too, don't you, Yuki?
 ...... I don't know because I don't gain weight when I eat.
 You have an enviable constitution. ......
 So, what are you going to do? ¶Want to play another game with these guys?
 No, let's not. ¶I don't think I can beat Haruhi's luck today.
 So you're admitting defeat gracefully. ¶Then let's break up today.
 Tomorrow morning, we're only going to take physical measurements, so ¶Get your height and weight quickly and meet us in the clubroom. ¶We'll use the free time to practice mahjong.
 ¶I don't care how much of a day it is for physical measurements, ¶I'm not comfortable playing mahjong during class time. ......
¶I'm not going to complain!  ¶If you don't spare no time for training, ¶you'll never get better! 
 You're okay with this, aren't you, Kozumi-kun and Yuki?
 Of course.
 Roger that.
 And Kyon?
 ...... Got it. ¶After the physical measurements are over, you can come here, right?
 Then it's settled. ¶I'll call Mikuru-chan. ¶So, we're breaking up for today! 
 ¶"The next day"

 Mikuru. Stop crying already.
 No matter how much you cry, it won't change the outcome.
 I know that. ......¶Ugh......
 Yosu. ¶Ah!  Asahina-san! 
 Haruhi!  What did you do to Asahina-san! 
 Don't be rude. ¶I didn't do anything! 
 Then why are you crying?
 Kyon-kun. It's not Suzumiya-san's fault.
 Heh?
 Actually, Mikuru-chan's weight had increased by ¶1 kilogram.
 Don't say that~.
 I made her eat a huge meal yesterday, you know. ¶That's why she didn't want to eat.
 That's why I didn't want to eat. ......
 Wait a minute. ¶Even though you've gained, it's only a kilo, right? ¶That doesn't count as an increase.
 You don't understand the heart of a girl, Kyung-kun. ...... ¶That mere 1 kilo is a big problem.
 ¶I don't think it's a line from you who forced me to eat.
 Besides, you said yourself yesterday that one or two kilos is within the margin of error.
 Oh, was it?
 Well, there's no point in lamenting the results ¶ that have come out.
 ¶If you move your body as much as you can in the afternoon's fitness test, ¶I'm sure you'll lose a kilo or so in no time.
 Yes. ......
 Well, now that Kyon's here, too, ¶ let's start playing mahjong!  ¶Mikuru-chan, take care of the tea.
 Yes, I understand! 
 Asahina-san's face changed!  ¶Maid spirit won over maiden spirit! 
 Oh, is it the end of lunch break already? ¶I'm in a good place. ......

 I'm sorry, too. ¶I'm so close to taking you down ¶ after I've got you so close ......
 You've got your fitness test this afternoon, right? ¶It's a hassle, but let's just get it over with and we'll play mahjong again after school.
 I'm going to go to the gym and count the number of repetitive jumps.
 I'm in charge of measuring the 50-metre run in the schoolyard. ¶Come on, Mikuru, let's go! 
 Okay.
 I'm going back to class too. See you after school. ......
 No dialogue.
 ............
 I'm going too. ¶Kyung, get on with it! 
 In our class, ¶we're going to measure your grip strength. ...... ¶Now, let's see where we start.
 MARK01_01_00
 Let's go back to the classroom and measure your grip strength. ......
 Mwah, what's this bizarre scene? ¶Everyone in the class is huddled four by four ¶playing on a handheld games console?
You're late, Kyung. ¶I'm tired of waiting.
 Taniguchi!  ¶What the hell is this? ¶Test your grip strength?
 That can wait. ¶Now let's not test grip strength, let's test sparring ability.
 Sparring strength test?
 Yeah, that's right. ¶Now we're in the middle of an unprecedented mahjong boom. ¶Jang-ryoku's more important than grip strength! 
 Yeah, yeah. ¶Grip strength is obsolete. ¶Modern times should focus on sparring ability! 
 Haruhi, you too!  ¶What the hell is Jakryoku?
 Come on, Kyon!  ¶Take my jankyoku test! 
 Listen to me! 
 No dialogue.
 This is ...... ¶This is what's happened here, too?
 Furuizumi!  ¶What do you mean, here too?
 ¶When I got back to class, everyone was playing ¶mahjong without measuring their back muscles. ¶I thought, ¶I thought, ¶I'm here too.
 Is this another power of Haruhi?
 Perhaps it's the result of Suzumiya-san wanting to play more ¶ mahjong. ¶So lunchtime alone wasn't enough for you.
 How much do you love mahjong?
 Furuizumi-kun!  You've come to the right place. ¶Now that we have all the men, ¶ let's start measuring our mahjong skills. Taniguchi-kun! 
 Oooh!  ¶Come on, Kyon, Furui. ¶Take the game console. Let's begin! 
 It's a bit too aggressive a development, but it can't be helped. ¶Because I failed to finish off Haruhi earlier, too. I'll let you decide here! 
 MARK01_01_01
 I did it!  ¶I knew my sparring ability was great! 
 Damn. ¶I can't believe I lost to Haruhi. ...... ¶Why?
 Difference in ability? ¶ Or is it a difference in natural talent?
 You can say whatever you like. ...... ¶ Well, whatever. You win this time. ¶ But next time, I'm gonna win! 
 ¶I love your grace and your challenger's spirit.
 Come at me anytime. ¶I'll beat you as many times as I have to.
 As for me, I'd be happier if Suzumiya-san keeps winning and stays in a good mood.
 No dialogue.
 ¶If she goes beyond good mood and gets too bossy, ¶she might say she's going to conquer the world with mah-jongg.
 That's not good. ¶Then, so that you don't increase your popularity, ¶Can you beat Suzumiya-san in moderation?
 I think it would be difficult for me, so ......
 You're throwing the whole thing at me! 
 Ahhhh ...... ¶I thought my sparring skills were the best in the class ......
 No dialogue.
 At this level, the girls would laugh at me. ¶I'll work harder and become irresistible! 
 Taniguchi's really getting into the swing of things. ¶IfI'mgreatatmahjong,¶ hebelieveshe'llbeattractivetothegirls.
 The whole class is playing mahjong, it's a bizarre scene. ...... ¶The whole school is like this.
 No matter how much it's booming, ¶ it might be a bit too much.
 I think we need to tell the long gate and ask them to ¶correct it.
 Right. ......
 Come on, measure your grip strength quickly, ¶One more sparring strength test!  ¶We'll train in the clubroom after school! 
 You're still gonna do it!  ¶You're gonna fight for 24 hours! 
 MARK01_01_02
I'm at the top of the list? ......¶ It's a rare thing, isn't it?
 Oh, God!  ¶I can't believe I lost to you, Furuizumi. ¶This is a mistake!  It's a cheat! 
 ¶It wasn't rigged, ¶it's a cheat, it's a terrible cheat.
 I just happened to be lucky. ¶In terms of ability, Suzumiya-san's much better than me.
 That's right. Furuizumi-kun was just lucky. ¶I'm better than you in terms of ability. ¶If we do it again, I'm sure I'll win! 
 Thank goodness ......¶ you're not in a bad mood.
 You're going through a lot, too.
 ¶It's nothing compared to dealing with closed spaces.
 Oh my God, ......¶ I thought my sparring skills were the best in my class. ......
 Girls will laugh at you for this. ¶I'll work harder and become irresistible! 
 Taniguchi's really getting into the swing of things. ¶IfI'mgreatatmahjong,¶ hebelieves he'll be popular with the girls.
 The whole class is playing mahjong, it's a bizarre scene. ...... ¶The whole school is like this.
 No matter how much it's booming, ¶ it might be a bit too much.
 I'll have to tell the long gate and ask them to fix it¶.
 Right. ......
 Now, quickly measure your grip strength, ¶One more sparring strength test!  ¶I'm going to win this time! 
 Haruhi. Are you forgetting I'm here? ¶Me, who's an even stronger opponent than Furuizumi! 
 Oh, I didn't know Kyon was here too. ¶I completely forgot.
 You're oblivious!  ¶Crap, I can't stop crying! 
 MARK01_01_03
 Yaaaah!  ¶Iamnumberone! 
 You're doing pretty good. ¶I underestimated you, Taniguchi.
 You know what they say, the hawk with the talons hides them, right? ¶that's exactly what it is.
 What's with the hawk? ¶You just happened to be lucky.
 Hoo ...... Call it what you will. ¶I'm still at the top of my game.
 ¶ That attitude with the room to breathe ...... ¶ I'm pissed off, but a result's a result. ¶I accept defeat this time.
 (Thank God ...... he accepts losing. ¶ This will create a closed space¶ ¶ I don't have to worry about that.)
 Alright, we're one step closer to our ambition now! 
 Ambition? What's that?
 It's an unprecedented mahjong boom right now. ¶Mahjong-playing guys are popular with the girls.
 I'm going to become the strongest guy in my class ...... or at least the strongest guy at North High, and I'm going to become irresistible! 
 That's your ambition? ......
 He's totally influenced by this world, isn't he?
 Oh. ¶ He's convinced that if he's the best mahjong player, ¶ he'll be irresistible to girls.
 The whole school is with him now. ¶The whole school loves mahjong and wants to get stronger.
 No matter how much it booms, ¶ it might be a bit too much.
 I'm going to have to tell Nagato to fix it¶.
 Right. ......
 Come on, measure your grip quickly, ¶One more sparring strength test!  ¶Because this time I'm going to win! 
 ¶Sweetheart,...... ¶I'm sorry, but I'm gonna win next time too. ¶To achieve my ambition! 
Interesting, isn't it? ¶I'll crush your ambition. ¶Go for it! 
 It's a shambolic ambition. ......
 MARK01_01_04
 Alright. Looks like my sparring skills were ¶number one.
 That's impossible. ¶You're saying my sparring ability is inferior to Kyung's?
 No need to lament, Suzumiya. Sparring ability is not something that can be determined in just one game.
 It's something that is determined after repeated games and verification of match data.
 I see. ¶In short, it's just a coincidence that Kyon won, isn't it?
 Did you listen to the explanation?
 Suzumiya's right. ¶Kyon won just by chance.
 What was the explanation earlier?
 ¶If it's just luck, ¶I won't be among the losers. ¶In other words, I'm as good as winning the game now! 
 Yeah, that's right. ¶I think that's fine with me too.
 How can that be? ¶I demand a satisfactory explanation! 
 Well, well, well, well. ¶You've got to get up in Suzumiya-san's face here.
 We don't want you to be in a bad mood and have a closed space.
 Damn. I'm at the top of the list. ......
 Aa~a......¶I thought my sparring ability was the best in the class, but ¶I can't believe I lost to Kyon. ......
 ¶I'm not good enough, the girls will laugh at me. ¶I'll work harder and become irresistible! 
 Taniguchi's really getting into the swing of things. ¶IfI'mgreatatmahjong,¶ hebelieves he'll be popular with the girls.
 The whole class is playing mahjong, it's a bizarre scene. ...... ¶The whole school is like this.
 No matter how much it's booming, ¶ it might be a bit too much.
 I'll have to tell the long gate and ask them to fix it¶.
 Right. ......
 Now, quickly measure your grip strength, ¶One more sparring strength test!  ¶I'm going to win again next time! 
 It's supposed to be Haruhi winning after all!  ¶That's impossible! 
 MARK01_02_00
 Gymnasium. Repetitive horizontal jump here. ...... ¶Hey? There's no one here. ¶There's just Asahina-san, the measurement officer.
 Thanks for your hard work, Asahina-san. ......
 Ah, Kyon-kun~.
 It's pretty deserted, but ¶maybe I'm the last?
 Nah. I've been waiting for you since a while ago, but nobody's coming.
 ¶Everyone in my class was playing mahjong in the classroom. ......
 Mahjong in the classroom? ¶No matter how much it's booming, skipping the physical fitness test to play mahjong. ......
 Um, Kyung, do you know how to do the horizontal jump?
 Yes, I do. I did it in junior high school.
 Then, please stand across the white line in the middle.
 ( ¶ You can't cut corners when it comes to the horizontal leap. ¶ Show your athleticism, ¶ Asahina-san's likability ......)
 Wait a minute! 
 Eh?
 You guys are members of the SOS Squad, as I recall, right?
 Well, yeah, but so what? ¶ Or rather, who were you?
 Don't forget!  ¶I'm the head of the Competitive Research Unit! 
 Ow! 
Please don't shout at me. ¶You're scaring Asahina-san.
 Sorry, sorry. ......
 So, the head of the Competitive Research Institute, ¶What do you want from us?
 You're going to play mahjong with me! 
 Huh?
 When I tried to challenge your Commander to a game, ¶I was told to go and beat him first.
 So I'll let you win! 
 Haruhi, you're selfish. ......
 ¶If you guys refuse to fight, ¶I'll call it a non-win for me, ¶is that okay?
 (If we didn't fight, ¶ what would Haruhi say ......)
 No. I accept this match. ¶Because I, as a member of the HIRA-dan, have a duty to protect the honour of the SOS-dan.
 Kyon-kun, you're so cool.
 Then receive this game machine!  ¶Let the games begin immediately! 
 Alright!  I would say ......, but ¶There are only three of us here now. ¶What about the other one?
 I'll take care of it! 
 Who's that?
 Hi.
 Ah, Mr. Niikawa! 
 No, sir. I'm just a passing bread deliveryman. ¶I'm here to deliver bread to the purchasing department.
 Why are you here, Mr. Niikawa?

 I've come to investigate the school on the orders of the 'agency', ¶you seemed to be having trouble, so I ......
 Uncle Beard!  ¶Will you be a mensch?

 My name is Niikawa. If it's all right with me.
 I look forward to working with you!  ¶Come on, SOS corps hiradan members, play with me! 
 MARK01_02_01
 I've made it to the top! 
 Well, that was brilliant, Asahina-san. ¶When did you polish your skills?
 I didn't hone my skills. ¶It was just a fluke.
 ¶It's very Asahina-san to be humble like that.
 If it was Haruhi, she'd be bragging about it with a bunch of pouting.
 She's quite skilled for a high school girl. ¶That was brilliant.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 Do you think Asahina-san is ¶excellent¶, too, Mr. Shinkawa?
 Yes, I do. I'm impressed. ¶If you get the chance, ¶I'd love to meet you again.
 Well, I'll leave you to it. ¶We have more investigations to continue. ......
 You drove off at a very fast pace. ......
 It's so cool, so dandy.
 It's ...... humiliating.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 Huh?
 I can't believe I lost to such a pretty, natural, full-blooded woman ¶ ...... ¶ Alright, we're going to train all night today on the internet! 
 Listen, the next time you fight will be your last!  ¶You'd do well to remember! 
 ¶Like a heroic villain¶ ¶that's a throwaway line. ......
 ¶I've got myself in a hell of a lot of trouble¶.
 No dialogue.
 Yeah. ...... ¶............
 Huh? Are you in a bad mood?
 Uh, no. ¶I just wondered if it was good that I was on top. ......
 Eh?
 I really wanted Kyon-kun to be the ¶top.
 Asahina-san. ......
But because Kyung-kun was with me, ¶ it was very reassuring. ¶That's probably why we got the top. ......
 Thank you.
 Oh, no. ¶I didn't do anything that would warrant a thank you. ......
 Okay, then, ¶shall we measure your repetitive lateral jump?
 Oh, yeah. ¶That's why we're here, isn't it?
 ( ¶And yet no one comes in to measure ¶Is the whole school playing mah-jongg?
 If so, that's a bit excessive. ¶ I'll have to ask Nagato to correct it. ......)
 Well then, Kyon-kun, let's go~.
 Ha, yes!  ¶ Alright, I'll set a new world record! 
 Alright, start! 
 That's it!  Wow, from ......! 
 Kyaah, Kyung-kun! 
 No dialogue.
 He was so overzealous that he slipped and ......
 Kyon-kun!  Kyon-kun!  ¶ Kyon-kun! 
 MARK01_02_02
 I'm sorry. ¶I jumped in and took the top spot. ......
 Well, that was awesome, Mr. Shinkawa. ¶You're a good mahjong player.
 Outrageous. ¶I only dabbled a little when I was younger.
 Really? ¶Your hands and your eye contact are not just like a man's, huh?
 Ha-ha-ha. ...... ¶So, that's enough for today. ¶We have more research to do. ......
 You drove off at a very fast pace. ......
 Mr. Niikawa, you looked like you were having a lot of fun.
 I know, right? ¶I'm sure he loves mahjong.
 It's ...... humiliating.
 No dialogue.
 Eh?
 I can't believe I lost ¶ to a bearded uncle who jumped in. ...... ¶ Alright, we're going to train all night today in online mahjong! 
 Listen, the next time you fight will be your last!  ¶You'd do well to remember! 
 ¶Like a heroic villain¶ ¶that's a throwaway line. ......
 ¶Something's gotten us into a hell of a lot of trouble.
 Yeah. But it was fun. ¶I got to play mahjong with Kyon-kun. ......
 Ho, really, Asahina-san. ......
 Kyon-kun. ¶Will you play with me again next time?
 Of course, of course. ¶I mean, I think we'll be hitting in the clubroom after school today. ......
 Yeah, that's true, too. ¶Then we'll measure your repetitive horizontal jump, shall we?
 Yes, that's right. ¶That's why we're here, isn't it?
 ( ¶And yet no one comes in to measure ¶Is the whole school playing mah-jongg?
 If so, that's a bit excessive. ¶ I'll have to ask Nagato to correct it. ......)
 Well then, Kyon-kun, let's go~.
 Ha, yes! 
 Yo, start!  ¶¶¶I'm going to ......
 ¶Ha-ha-ha ...... I'll set a good record and get praise from ¶Asahina-san!  ¶Ha-ha-ha-ha ......
 Yes, 30 seconds.
 Ha ha ha ...... ¶How many times was the record?
 Let's see... ...... ¶Hey? How many times was it?
 When I pressed the stopwatch button, ¶I forgot how many times I counted! 
 Eh?
 I'm sorry, Kyung-kun. ¶Can you let me measure it again?
Yeah, yeah, okay, but ......
 Okay, then, get into position, ¶YoYoYoYoYoYo......
 Start!  ¶Yes, yes, yes, yes. ......
 ¶Ha-ha-ha......, this time, ¶Count properly this time, Asahina-san. ¶Ha ha ha ......
 Aah, I counted 12 twice!  ¶One more time, please! 
 What the hell?
 And so the measurements went on and on. ......
 MARK01_02_03
 I did it!  I won! 
 Hiiii. It's an emergency.
 I know, right? If Haruhi finds out, ¶ I don't know what she'll say. ......
 How's it going? Isn't it great? ¶I've been honing my skills day and night at online mahjong. ¶I'm getting pretty good at it! 
 Suzumiya-san, I'm sure you'll get really angry. ......
 It's okay if you're just angry. ¶There might be a closed space. ......
 That's a problem. ¶I can't believe ¶closed space will occur¶ because of a game I participated in. ......
 No dialogue
 No dialogue.
 ¶It's not just online mahjong I'm doing to improve my mahjong skills.
 ¶Using computer mahjong software with advanced AI ......
 What should I do, Kyung-kun? ......
 Hmmm...... that's right!  ¶You can just pretend it didn't happen! 
 Eh?
 We're going to pretend that the game didn't just happen. ¶Fortunately, the only people who know there was a game ¶are the four of us here.
 ¶If we keep quiet, ¶Haruhi will never know.
 That's an excellent idea. ¶Then, I'll just say that this matter must remain unspoken.
 That's a great idea, Kyon-kun.
 Wait, wait a minute!  Don't ignore me and proceed on your own! 
 Hey, you're the head of the Competitive Research Institute, aren't you? ¶Did you come here to do the horizontal jump?
 Then get in line behind Kyon-kun.
 Oh, hey!  ¶Don't go through with it like nothing happened!  ¶I beat you guys! 
 Well, I have more research to do, so ¶I'll leave you to it. ......
 Thank you for your time! 
 Thank you very much.
 Well, wait!  ¶Uncle Dan beat me too, right?
 Okay, Kyung-kun, ¶I'm going to start the measurement for the horizontal jump. ¶Are you ready?
 Ready when you are! 
 All right, let's get started! 
 Damn it!  This is unacceptable!  ¶I'm gonna sue you! 
 MARK01_02_04
 Okay, I win!  ¶Did you understand the power of the Hira club members?
 ¶You've underestimated ¶your power, it seems.
 ¶As expected of a member of the SOS Squad, even a member of the Hila Squad. ¶I lost.
 All right, we'll train all night today at Net Mahjong!  ¶Next time we fight, I won't lose!  ¶Farewell! 
 I wonder how many more times that guy's gonna ¶ challenge me to a fight. ......
 Well, at least the SOS Squad's dignity has been preserved. ¶Then Haruhi won't complain.
 Well, that was brilliant. Even though she's still in high school, she put up a fight that made her look like a pro.
 That's too much praise, Mr. Shinkawa.
No, no, no. I also ¶ played a lot of mahjong when I was younger, so ¶ I think I know what I'm doing.
 Your skill is outstanding.
 Oh, thank you.
 ¶I hope we have the opportunity to play together again.
 Now, if you'll excuse me. ¶We'll be continuing our investigation at ......
 Even though I know it's flattering, ¶ it's nice to be told that much. ......
 ............
 What's the matter, Asahina-san? ¶Is there something on my face?
 Kyon-kun, you were so strong and cool. ¶I'm so in love with you.
 No dialogue.
 Oh, no, even Asahina-san. ¶Please don't flatter me.
 No, no. I'm not flattering you. ¶Kyon-kun, who took the top spot, was ¶very dependable and wonderful.
 (Asahina-san's moist eyes are staring at me.) ¶Gosh, I'm glad I took the top!  ¶ Good job, me! )
 Oh, by the way, Kyon-kun, ¶ you're here to measure the repeated lateral jump, right?
 ¶Yes. ¶I had an unscheduled interruption, so ¶I forgot all about it. ......
 ( ¶ And yet, while we were playing mahjong, ¶ not a single person showed up in the gym.
 Does that mean the whole school is playing mahjong? ¶ If so, this is going too far. ¶ I'll have to ask Nagato to fix it. ......)
 Um, Kyon-kun?
 Yes?
 Can you take your position as we take measurements?
 Yes, sir! 
 (Show off your light movements, ¶ and I'll increase Asahina-san's likability ¶ even more! )
 All right, start! 
 That's it!  Wow, from ......! 
 Kyaah, Kyon-kun! 
 He was so overzealous that he slipped and ......
 Kyon-kun!  Kyon-kun!  ¶ Kyon-kun! 
 MARK01_03_00
 First we're going to run 50m in the schoolyard. ¶...... Huh? Isn't that Nagato? ¶You came to run too?
 Yeah. ......
 I've never seen you run, but ¶Are you a good runner?
 You can change the settings at will. ¶If you set it to fastest mode, you can set a world record.
 Oh, yeah? ¶I'd rather not use the fastest mode for now.
 It'll be fine. ¶somewhatbelowaverageforhighschoolers.
 That's quite a trick, isn't it? ......
 Hey, Kyung. ¶You're here to run, right?
 Yes, sir. ¶But there's no one else here, is there? ¶Just me and Nagato?
 Everyone's probably playing mahjong in the classroom right now. ¶The mahjong craze is heating up.
 I can't believe they're skipping physical fitness tests to play mahjong. ......
 Hey, Nagato. Isn't this escalating a bit too much?
 This environment is conducive to the study of mahjong. ......
 That may be so, but ......¶ today's physical fitness test is just barely allowed,
 If the students start playing mahjong in front of the class, it's not a good idea.
 Okay, I'll make some adjustments. I'll fine-tune it.
 By all means, do so.
 Tsuruya-san, then. ¶Please measure the 50-metre run! 
Pfft... ......¶ Do you think I'm going to let you run it so easily, Kyon?
 Huh?
 I'm going to play mahjong before the 50-metre race! 
 That's a strong turn of events right off the bat! 
 ¶When I saw you playing with Haru-nyan and the others at lunchtime, ¶I thought I'd love to play with you.
 I've prepared a game console for four players.
 Well, well, if I refuse now, ¶I won't be able to proceed with the conversation, so ¶I may as well say OK,
 Even if we put Nagato in the menus, ¶ there's only three of us here, okay?
 Then don't worry. ¶We've got people on board for just such an eventuality! 
 Hoi! 
 Kyung~!  Help me~! 
 Kunikida!  Why you?
 ¶When I came to measure the 50-meter run, ¶I got caught. ¶They said they'd have you work for me. ......
 I didn't think you'd caught Kunikida and were preparing to ¶...... ¶Tsuruya-san, you must be scared! 
 Come on, Kyon-kun. ¶I'll add him to the men and we'll have a serious fight! 
 Okay, fine. ¶Nothing against Nagato either?
 No. Outdoor mahjong is interesting.
 Oh, I see.
 I'm telling you, I'm going to teach myself Tsuruya-style mahjong at the tender age of 20. ¶It's not that easy to win! 
 There is such a thing as the Tsuruya school of mahjong. ......
 Come on, let's get to it!  I'll do my best! 
 Well then, let's go. Tsuruya-san! 
 MARK01_03_01
 We won. ......
 What a surprise!  ¶To defeat Tsuruya's mahjong technique,...... ¶You're not a simpleton, are you?
 It's true, Nagato was strong just now. ......
 Hey, Nagato. Did you use any power?
 I didn't do anything. This is my current strength.
 Oh, I see. ¶I'm sorry for being rude.
 I'm sorry, but I admit I lost today. ¶But next time, you won't lose! 
 ............
 What's wrong, Nagato? ¶Your expression seems to have relaxed somewhat. ¶Are you happy to have come out on top?
 I'm happy. ¶I'm happy when I can beat someone strong.
 I see. Well, that's good. ......
 I'm happy to meet a good opponent, too. ¶Until the next time we play each other, ¶we'll both be working on our skills even more! 
 ...... agreed.
 Oh, a firm handshake between rivals!  ¶It's a hot development, like a sports manga! 
 Oh, um... Can I go home now?
 Oh, I forgot about Kunikida! 
 Oops, that's right. ¶You caught him out of nowhere, but thank you for fighting to the end.
 I'll untie the ropes now.
 You tied him up! 
 Here you go. You're free to go.
 Sorry, Kunikida. ¶I'm sorry I got you involved in our fight. ......
 No problem. It's okay. I'm going back to class. ¶Mahjong, it was fun.
 You left like nothing happened. ¶You forced me into this, so piss off a little bit!  ¶Show some presence! 
 MARK01_03_02
 I won, Nyoro!  ¶After all, the Tsuruya-style mahjong technique is the strongest! 
That's Tsuruya-san. ¶ He is as good as a big mouth.
 I admire it. ......
 Kyon-kun, you seem to be ¶trained by Haru-nyan every day, but ¶it seems you weren't my opponent yet.
 I admit defeat this time, but ¶I won't leave you beaten either. ¶Next time, I'll win! 
 Graceful. ......
 I like your challenging eyes!  ¶I'll accept a challenge from anyone, anytime, anyplace! 
 Oh, um... Can I go home now?
 Ah, Kunikida. You're still here.
 Oops, that's right. ¶You caught me out of nowhere, but ¶I appreciate you fighting to the end.
 You tied him up, huh?
 Hoi. ¶You're free to go.
 Okay, I'm going back to class. ¶Mahjong, it was fun, Kyung.
 You left like nothing happened. ¶No last words even though you lost. ...... ¶Are you okay with that, Kunikida?
 ............
 Hmm? What's the matter, Nagato. ¶No way, you're just upset because you lost?
 No. ¶I was playing back the current game in my brain. ¶Analyzing the cause of defeat.
 Oh, yeah.
 Tch tch tch tch ...... ¶ Don't waste your time thinking about it.
 The only reason you lost ......¶ is because you challenged me to a fight! 
 ¶You challenged me to a fight! 
 Don't be shocked, Nagato. ¶Tsuruya-san just wanted to say a cool line! 
 I know. ¶I just pretended to be surprised ¶ to enhance the scene.
 Oh, I see.
 By the way, Kyung-kun. ¶What about the 50-metre run? ¶Would you like me to measure you?
 Yes, I do. That's why we're here. ......
 Well, let's measure it right away. Sorry, Yukinko, but you'll have to be the one to measure at the finish line.
 I'll call the start here.
 Roger that.
 Okay, Kyung-kun, stand at the start line.
 No dialogue.
 Ready.
 In position ...... Yoi, dong! 
 Alright!  ¶I'm gonna break the middle school record!  ¶I'm running as fast as I can! 
 Not so fast! 
 What?
 ¶None of you will ever run in front of me again! 
 What?
 Goo-rooool!  ¶What the hell is that?
 That doesn't make any sense! 
 MARK01_03_03
 I'm on top, aren't I?
 Yeah, looks that way.
 I'm good at mahjong, even though I look like this. ¶I play mahjong games on the internet.
 That's very impressive. ......
 Hey, what's going on? ¶You all look so delicate. ......
 It's a shame. ......
 Eh?
 Kyon-kun, I'm sorry. ¶I didn't expect¶this to happen. ......
 No, it's a competition, so these things happen.
 Even though I picked you at random, ¶I thought you could read the air a bit more. ......
I know, right? ¶If you'd seen how the first half unfolded, you'd be able to guess what we should do. ......
 Huh? ¶Is that maybe me?
 Kyung-kun, Yuki. ¶I'll buy you a juice or something as an apology. ¶I'll follow you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you. ......
 Hey. Where am I? ¶Can I go home now......? ¶Kyorn......
 Oh, that's bringing tears to my eyes. ¶I wonder why......
 MARK01_03_04
 Okay, I guess I win. ¶Tsuruya-style mahjong technique, defeated! 
 ¶While I haven't seen you for a while, you've grown up a lot, ¶My child. ......
 Who's my child?
 Just a little mischievous. ¶But more importantly, you fought brilliantly, ¶Kyung-kun.
 You're the man I've always hoped you'd be.
 Thanks for that. ......
 However!  ¶I didn't give even 10% of my ability in the current game! 
 ¶I told you before we started that I would give it my all! 
 Come on, I don't remember.
 Wow, I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
 Anyway!  ¶If you think you've beaten Tsuruya-style mahjong with just one lucky win, you're wrong! 
 It was a lucky win! 
 Um... Can I go home now?
 Oops, that's right. ¶You caught me out of nowhere,¶ thanks for fighting to the end.
 I'll untie the rope now.
 You tied me up! 
 Hoi. ¶You're free to go.
 Okay, I'm going back to class. Mahjong, that was fun, Kyung.
 You left like nothing happened. ¶No last words after losing. ¶That's too easy.
 Is that okay, Kunikida?
 ............
 Hm? What's the matter, Nagato. ¶Are you down about losing to me?
 No, I'm not. ¶I was playing back the current game in my brain. ¶Analysing the cause of defeat.
 Oh, yeah.
 Analysis complete. ¶The cause of the loss was due to contingencies. ¶If the data was correct, I would have won.
 What's that contingent factor?
 The so-called bakazuki. ¶In other words, now that's a lucky win.
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!  ¶Oh, well, it was a fluke. ......
 No need to be discouraged. ¶Good luck is part of skill. ¶The value of a win is still the same. ......
 Thank you, Nagato. ¶Is ...... a pun now?
 Coincidentally ......
 Kyon-kun. ¶It looks like I was right, ¶It was a fluke win, huh?
 Unfortunately, it seems so. ¶But next time we fight, I'll beat Tsuruya-san with sheer force.
 I won't say next time, I'll rematch you right here and now! 
 Eh? What about the men? ¶Kunikida's been released, right?
Don't worry. ¶I've got people on board for just such an occasion! 
 Here! 
 Untie me!  ¶What have I done?
 ¶I've got other people, if you want.
 ¶How many students have you got?
 MARK01_04_00
 ¶I've been worrying about this and that, ¶I'm getting a light headache. ¶Get some headache medicine from the infirmary. ......
 Excuse me. ¶I've got a bit of a headache. ......
 Oh. Kyung!  ¶You came! 
 Oh, wow!  Taniguchi?
 No~, I screwed up. ¶I was doing a repetitive lateral jump, ¶I slipped and ...... sprained my foot.
 Repetitive lateral jump ......? ¶Oh, yeah. You were trying to show Asahina-san how good you are, weren't you?
 Ugh!  How did you know?
 Don't know.
 But you're all cold. ¶I say I sprained my leg, and the only one who lent me his shoulder was Kunikida. ......
 That's funny. ¶No matter how much it was Taniguchi who fell,
 I don't think that kind Asahina-san would leave an injured person alone. ......
 Of course she tried to help. ¶But Suzumiya stopped her. ¶She said it was my fault for thinking of something jealous. ......
 ( As expected of Haruhi. You saw through his ulterior motives.)
 But I'm glad, Kyon. ¶That you used a temporary illness to come check on me.
 No, it's not like that. ......
 Don't be embarrassed. ¶After all, what you have is a friend.
 Kyon, you're a friend from the bottom of my heart!  ¶Kuuuuh!  ......
 Ha-ha-ha-ha ......
 ( ¶ Looks like I'll have to babysit Taniguchi for a while. ¶ Apparently, coming here was a mistake ......)
 MARK01_05_00
 It doesn't make any sense, but ¶ let's take a look at the Competitive Research Institute's club room. ......
 Hello, ......!  ¶All the members of the club are facing the computer with a hot gaze! 
 ¶This heat is crazy, no matter how much it's the Kompi Lab. ......
 Who's this? ¶Hmm? You're the SOS Squad, I believe. ...... ¶What do you want?
 I don't have much of an errand. ...... ¶What are you all into? ¶Screens, let me take a look.
 No, no, no!  Don't look! 
 This is ...... undressing mahjong! 
 No, it's not!  ¶This is not naughty mahjong!  ¶Lulu-chan doesn't undress! 
 Lulu-chan?
 She's the protagonist of this mahjong game. ¶I'm Lulu, princess of fairyland! 
 ¶If you declare such an embarrassing name in high spirits, ......
 Lulu-chan is the idol of the Kompiken. ¶We want to know everything about Lulu-chan, ¶we're playing day and night.
 Ha, I see. ......
 You've been giving me mindless replies since a while ago, ¶You haven't heard anything from Nagato-san?
 Nagato? Do you know anything about that guy?
 This "Lulu-chan and the Delightful Sammers" is a game programmed by ¶Nagato-san.
 Hou. That's Nagato. ¶I'm not so sure about the title. ......
All right, I get it. ¶You peeked into this room because of ¶Nagato-san's guidance.
 Now I'm going to give you a full lecture on Lulu-chan's charms! 
 No, no. ¶I'm not really interested in Lulu ......
 Don't say that. ¶In five minutes, you'll be a Lulu-chan moe! 
 Oh, my God, someone help me! 
 MARK02_00_00
 ¶What brought us all together today was ¶Nothing else.
 ¶We're participating in a flea market at Green Country Park this weekend.
 Flea market? ¶What the hell for?
 ¶To raise money for SOS. ¶As it is now, we won't even be able to buy Mikuru-chan to make us tea.
 You don't have that much money. ¶Even so, what have you been doing?
 I still had money left over from my time in the Literature Club.
 You've been using the money from the Literature Club? ¶Isn't that a problem?
 I only borrowed it temporarily. I'll pay it back exactly sooner or later. ¶That's why you're not in the flea market. ¶What's your problem?
 ¶I have no objection to participating in a flea market, but what are you selling?
 ¶If it's Asahina-san's cosplay costumes, ¶I'm sure you can make some money. ......
 That's a no-no. ¶That costume is the most important thing to Mikuru-chan next to her life.
 How is that possible? ¶You forced me to wear it, and I'm sure Asahina-san is annoyed! 
 Kyon, shut up. ¶Right, Mikuru-chan? ¶That's next to life, isn't it?
 Uh, is that right? ......
 ¶Yes, it is!  ¶Of course it is! 
 Then that's the way it's got to be.
 It was easily pushed aside! 
 So, books and games on the bookshelf?
 That's impossible.
 I know, right? ¶What do you sell?
 ¶Everyone's got one or two things back home that they could make money on, right? ¶Come on, bring it in.
 Don't be selfish. ¶Why should we give you our personal belongings?
 Hey, Kyung. ¶You're saying you don't want the SOS Squad to go under?
 ...... You didn't say that.
 And I'm not ¶ asking you to bring me an expensive item.
 Just bring ¶something that you don't need but ¶someone might buy it for you.
 Like a piece of tableware with your name on it from a friend's wedding, or a hand-knitted scarf from your ex-girlfriend.
 Unfortunately, I don't have any of those things!  ¶And it's against human morals to sell off that kind of stuff! 
 I'm just giving you an example. ¶Used clothes, used books, anything. ¶Anyway, everyone, bring anything you can sell.
 All right. ¶So, I'm gonna go to ...... for some rare cards that I'm dabbling in.
 Mwah? This is ......
 Excuse me. The board game you reserved ¶ has arrived, so I'll leave you to it.
 I heard that a small closed space has been created. ¶Suzumiya-san, you seem to be ¶very concerned about the lack of funds.
 No dialogue.
 I see. ......
I'm going anyway. ¶ Cooperate with Mr. Suzumiya, ¶ get rid of his heartache.
 Oh, oh. ......
 How about you, Mikuru-chan?
 I think I have something at home, too.
 ...... my house ¶I don't have anything to bring here.
 Oh, it's true that Yuki's house ¶may have nothing but the bare necessities. ......
 Then Yuki, go to the Competitive Research Institute and ¶ get me some things that I can sell. ¶Used computers, game software...
 Wait a minute. ¶You're going to sell Compi Lab stuff?
 ¶The members of the Kompi Lab are under my absolute obedience. ¶It's only natural they'd cooperate with the SOS! 
 Naturally? ......
 Okay, Yuki?
 Roger that. I'm going.
 I understand! 
 ............
 Hm? What's wrong, Asahina-san?
 Oh, um, ......¶I wasn't sure what to bring. ......
 (There seems to be a lot of suspicious goods at Asahina-san's house, bought by mail order. ......)
 I can't decide which one ......¶ by myself, so I'm going to go talk to ¶Tsuruya-san.
 After all, everyone's going to cooperate with Haruhi's idea.
 You're the only one who hasn't made up your mind. ¶What are you going to do?
 ¶I don't want Asahina-san's tea to be undrinkable. ¶I'll cooperate.
 (And there's also the matter of the closed space. ......)
 Then tomorrow lunchtime, ¶gather in the clubroom with the items to be exhibited.
 Everyone's gone for the day, so we'll break up like this.
 Okay. What about you?
 I'm going to look online to see how I can make a lot of money at the flea market.
 Okay. Well, I'm leaving. ¶Good-bye. ......
 ¶Although I said ......, it's still early to go straight home. ¶I think I'll go somewhere to kill some time. ......
 MARK02_01_00
 The one at Nagato, ¶I think he's in trouble with the Competitive Research Institute. ...... ¶Let's take a look at him for a bit.
 So, no matter how much Nagato-san asks, ¶I can't do what's impossible.
 No dialogue.
 Even if that's not the case, your Commander has ¶taken a lot of things away from us, ¶we're on the edge! 
 ............
 No dialogue.
 I guess we're still in trouble. ......
 Hmm? You're a member of the SOS group's HIRA club!  ¶ Did you come here to rob something, too?
 Oh, no. ¶I was worried about Nagato's condition, so I just came to check on her. ......
 Then why don't you take Nagato-san home with you? ¶We don't have anything we can give to the SOS Squad! 
 Ha, ha......
 ...... In the desk drawer, ¶I'm sure she's hiding something important.
 Giggle!  ¶Why, how did you get it?
 I guessed from the relaxed expression on his face when he looked at the drawer.
 ¶Has she seen through the grin on my face when I think there's treasure in the drawer? ¶As expected of Nagato-san.
 Yes, indeed, my drawers do indeed contain a variety of ¶precious game goods.
 But since they're all precious treasures of the Competitive Research Institute, ¶I can't just hand them over! 
 I can't leave empty-handed. ¶Suzumiya Haruhi's instructions are absolute: ......
I'm asking you to do the same. ¶If Haruhi's in a bad mood, it's a lot of trouble. ¶Can I have something, even if it's just a piece of junk?
 I refuse!  ¶I'd like to say ......, but I can't send you home empty-handed and ruin Nagato-san's reputation.
 Alright!  ¶Nagato-san, let's play mahjong with me! 
 A sudden mahjong match! 
 Here's the key to that drawer. ¶If you win, I'll give you ¶one thing of your choice from my treasure collection.
 And if you lose?
 No treasure, of course. ¶But the fact that you challenged me to a match and lost ¶is an excuse to go empty-handed, isn't it?
 Understood. I accept the mahjong match.
 Then let's get started. ¶Since there are only three men, ¶One more can be CPU, right?
 (If you go to the clubroom, you'll find Haruhi, but ¶ rather than complicate the conversation by talking to her, ¶ is it safer to play against the CPU? ......)
 Hello. ¶I'm just a cleaning lady passing by.
 (Also, Mr. Mori!  )
 Who are you, who are you?
 My name is Mori, I'm a cleaner. ¶I happened to be cleaning the corridor, and I heard that there was a shortage of mahjong men,
 I jumped in without a second thought. ¶How would you like to join me¶?
 Oh, if you're as nice as you are, ¶here's a favor from us. ¶We'd love to strike together! 
 I'm so happy, thank you! 
 What on earth is going on, Mr. Mori? ¶You didn't go to the closed space with Furusawa?
 ¶I didn't go out this time because it was a small closed space, ¶I didn't go out, I just kept patrolling, but ¶I got a whiff of this match ......
 I see. ¶You're sensitive to signs of a fight.
 What, you know the woman?
 No, I mean, can you play mahjong? ¶I just asked her. ......
 I see. ¶It's true that if you're a beginner who started playing in a boom, ¶you might not be able to balance it.
 My father was a strict mahjong fanatic, ¶ we played family mahjong every night since I was a kid, ¶ with a side dish at stake.
 I've been rubbed up against death or life, so ¶I'm somewhat confident in my skills.
 It's kind of an outlandish set-up! 
 Oh, I see. ...... ¶ He was a strict father, wasn't he? ¶I'm sorry for calling you a beginner and all that.
 I believe you so easily!  ¶And I'm even shedding tears of sympathy! 
 Well, then, let's start the game. ¶I'm sorry Nagato-san, but ¶I'll win this time! 
 MARK02_01_01
 I win. Thank goodness. ......
 ¶Good news is that I've mastered the art of surpassing Nagato-san. ¶I had the ¶confidence¶ that I'd mastered the skill beyond Nagato-san! 
 Promise. Get the keys out of the drawer.
 Okay, I'll do it. ¶It was my idea. ¶Here's the drawer key.
 Thank you. Select an item.
 Oh, I'll go with you!  ¶Some items should be handled with care.
 (Good job, Nagato.) ¶ Haruhi will be pleased if you bring back the loot. ¶ Then the closed space won't be expanded.)
 Then the losers will leave. ¶ The next time we have a chance to play each other, ¶ I'll let you win then.
Thank you, Mr. Mori. ¶Thanks for your help.
 No. ¶Because I was entertained too. ¶Then ......
 Thank you for your time! 
 Ah!  ¶That's ...... the only thing I can't do! 
 What's wrong?
 Hey, Mr. Nagato is trying to take ¶ the biggest treasure in the Competitive Research Institute! 
 The highest estimated value at the time of sale. ¶This is the decision.
 ¶So, even I know it's a ¶heroine from a very popular robot anime! 
 It's not a robot. Android.
 Heh. ¶You know quite a bit, Nagato.
 I like her too.
 Oh, really?
 I don't care what you have to say about that!  ¶If they take the figure, ¶I'll be in trouble! 
 It's an extremely rare item, sold only at the event, and by lottery, with a serial number, you know! 
 I know. That's why I chose this.
 If you know, give me a break!  ¶All the compilers worked together, and we finally got our hands on one ¶It's like a product of blood and sweat! 
 Don't worry. ¶I'll replicate it and put a replica on display.
 Exhibit a replica? ¶Then what about this original?
 Of course I'll return it.
 Well, that's fine. ...... ¶ But how do you make a replica? ¶It would take days, no, months, wouldn't it?
 Put the knife in homing mode, ¶ carve the plastic and you can do it in seconds.
 Huh?
 Ho, I know an American ¶modeller called Mr. Homing. ¶I'm going to ask him to do it for me.
 Oh, I see. ......
 (my poor excuse, but I think I've managed to cover it up for now)
 Then I'll borrow it for a while.
 Please don't scratch it!  ¶Please, I'm begging you! 
 Are you really going to sell replicas? ¶Won't they know?
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 It's okay. I'll make it exactly the same as the real thing.
 Well, it would be easy enough for Nagato to do it, but ¶ I don't know if I can sell something like that. ¶It looks like a scam, and it's heartbreaking, but ......
 Then would you rather sell the real thing and ¶ give the replica to the compilatory?
 ¶Okay, so it's a roundabout way of doing it. ¶Okay, let's do that!  ¶¶ is that the kind of problem you're talking about?
 MARK02_01_02
 Okay, we won!  ¶The treasure of the Compi Lab is dead! 
 ...... mission failed.
 I can't believe Nagato lost, let alone me! 
 ...... ¶We, the Kompi Lab, are determined to take a shot at the SOS group,
 The most important thing to remember is that the SOS group is not a group of people who are in charge of the SOS group! 
 ¶Their spirit of betting on the game is admirable, but as students, they have a lot of problems! 
 ¶The mahjong software that Nagato-san made for me was very helpful. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
 I didn't plan for the software I made to be the cause of my defeat.
 Don't worry about it, Nagato. ¶That's how good the software you made was.
 That's right, Nagato-san. ¶You fought an alter ego with the same power and ¶you just lost. Don't worry about it.
Nevertheless, a game is a game. ¶We cannot hand over the treasure of the Competitive Research Institute to you losers.
 Now, please leave! 
 Damn it!  ......
 ............
 Don't back down! 
 Well, that voice is ......! 
 I've heard your story. ¶Yuki, you win this game! 
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 ¶Yuki, you win this match! 
 Hey, what are you saying? ¶I was the one who won the game just now!  ¶I'm the one who won! 
 ¶Did you forget what you said earlier?
 What? ¶What did I say?
 You said this to Yuki. ¶'You fought an alter ego with the same powers and you just lost.' ......
 So, what about it?
 You declared that you were Yuki's alter ego. ¶In other words, it was Yuki who won this match! 
 That's ridiculous!  ¶An alter ego is just an example of a thing. ......
 It's disgusting!  ¶If you're a man, take responsibility for your words! 
 Ugh. ......
 ¶That's almost an accusation!  ¶It's almost an accusation, but ¶something makes sense! 
 You lose!  ¶Come on, give me the treasure! 
 No, no!  I won. ......
 No questions asked!  ¶Forever!  Seize that guy! 
 Understood.
 Furuizumi!  ¶You're back! 
 What the hell, you guys! 
 I'm sorry, the Commander's orders are absolute. ......
 Let go of me!  Stop it! 
 The key to the drawer in his breast pocket.
 Ok.
 ...... I see, so this is the key to the treasure chest. ¶So, let's have a look at the treasure, shall we? ¶Gufufu......
 Hee, you have an evil look on your face, which is unbecoming of a heroine! 
 Um, I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir, but ¶I'll leave you to it. ¶Have I been helpful?
 Yes, I have. ¶ Thanks to Mr. Mori's presence, ¶we were able to hit four. ¶Thank you very much.
 ¶Whenever you need a mensch, ¶call me. ¶I'll come flying in right away. See you soon. ......
 Thanks for your help! 
 Hey, Kyung!  ¶Are these girl dolls worth anything? ¶There's all kinds.
 No dialogue.
 I don't know. Don't ask me.
 ...... quite rare. ¶It should fetch a good price if sold.
 Oh, yeah. ¶Then I guess I'll just have to take it by the roots.
 No, don't do that!  ¶It's all compi's treasure! 
 ¶You shouldn't have lost the game. ¶Repent on your weakness! 
 No, so I'm the one who won. ......
 Gross!  ¶I'm done talking about it! 
 Hi, hi! 
 Commander, the treasure has been secured.
 Okay. ¶Then everyone, let's get the hell out of here! 
 ............
 Uh, uh, ...... ¶Thank you for your time! 
 I'm the one who won. ......¶Wow! 
MARK02_01_03
 Sorry, I'm sorry. I won. ¶ I didn't mean to go out on a limb. ......
 Oh, no. ¶It was a brilliant technique, Mr. Mori.
 I'm glad you complimented me.
 You're in trouble. ¶This was a match between me and Nagato-san. ......
 Why don't you just rank us?
 That's not how it works. What I want is a full settlement. ¶If one of us doesn't come out on top, ¶it can't be called a perfect settlement.
 I don't know if that's how it works. ......
 All right!  Well, then, let's play one more game ...... ¶No, let's keep playing ¶until one of us is on top! 
 That's not going to happen.
 You don't think so, ......? ¶Oh, okay!  ¶You can't play anymore because you have to work?
 No, sir. ¶I'm the one who just won the game. ¶I should be entitled to the treasure.
 Eh?
 ¶It's not good for us that Suzumiya-san is in a bad mood. ¶So, I'll take the treasure instead.
 Ah, you were part of the SOS-dan's ¶ gang, weren't you?
 I'm not a member. ¶I'm a stakeholder. ......
 I don't want to be. ¶This is a match between me and Nagato-san.
 ¶Suddenly barging in from the side and saying, ¶You won, so give me the treasure, ¶Such selfish talk. ......
 Guha! 
 Ah, Director!  ¶Mr. Mori, are you sure you're okay to do that?
 I didn't want to be rough with you, but there's no way I'm going to listen to you. ......
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to examine the drawer.
 Oh, so this is the treasure of the Kompiken. ¶There's a lot of anime and game figures.
 There are so many different kinds. ¶Which ones are worth anything?
 Second row from the back, third figure from the left. ¶It's the most valuable.
 That's the long gate. ¶You're familiar with this kind of information?
 This is it. ¶Now, I'll leave this to Kyon-kun.
 Eh? To me?
 Please give it to Suzumiya-san. ¶If you say you took it, ¶Suzumiya-san will surely be pleased.
 Well, even if you say that, ......
 I'll leave you with this. ¶Please call me again when you need a mensa. ¶I'll rush over immediately. Well, then. ......
 He's gone. ...... ¶Even though it's to avoid creating a closed space, ¶I'm a bit pushy. ......
 Hey, Nagato. Do you think I can take this figure home with me, ¶?
 No problem. ¶I'll take care of it if something goes wrong.
 Okay. ¶Then we'll leave before the director wakes up.
 That's good.
 ...... So, Mr. Director, ¶ don't feel bad! 
 MARK02_01_04
 Excuse me, I win.
 You're in trouble. ¶This was a match between me and Nagato-san, but ¶It doesn't make sense if you won.
 Not really.
 What?
 Did you forget, ¶I'm a member of the SOS Squad too.
 Huh? Don't tell me you're ......
You lost to me. ¶I mean, I lost to the SOS group. ¶That's why you have the treasure at ......
 Chi, no!  This is mine and Nagato-san's! 
 Well, well, please hear me out. ¶It's been quite some time since Nagato came here under Haruhi's orders, hasn't it?
 Well, we played a game of mahjong, so it's only natural! 
 But Haruhi doesn't know we've been playing mahjong.
 ¶If Nagato comes home late, ¶she might be getting numb.
 But then, what's wrong with that?
 The SOS squad's club room is right next door. ¶It wouldn't be surprising if that guy, who couldn't wait for Nagato's return, ¶just now came riding in.
 Ugh! 
 What do you think will happen if that happens?
 What do you mean, what will happen?
 Come on, what's going to happen? ¶Will I be punched, kicked or ¶or thrown off......
 Gobble......
 But there is only one ¶ ending that we will eventually reach.
 ¶Haruhi will take away every single one of Kompiken's treasures. ¶I'll bet all my money on it. It will absolutely happen.
 Ta, that may indeed be the case.
 So I have a proposal. ¶Give me one of the treasures. ¶I'll manage to round up Haruhi with it.
 That way, the damage can be kept to a minimum. ¶How's that not a bad deal?
 Shhh, but ......
 ¶While you're worrying about it, Haruhi might ¶jump in, right? ¶Give me the treasure by gracefully admitting defeat! 
 ...... unavoidable. ¶This is to minimise the damage.
 Take it!  ¶But only one thing! 
 Thank you for your understanding. ¶Longgate, the choice of treasure is yours. ¶You know more about games than I do.
 Understood.
 ...... I'll take this one.
 Ah!  ¶So, it's a limited production figure that's out of the gate!  ¶Nagato-san, please forgive me for that! 
 Impossible.
 That's not possible. ...... Ummm... ......
 You fainted, didn't you?
 You must have been in shock. ¶I'm sorry to hear that. ......
 That was a brilliant deal.
 It wasn't a deal. ¶I just told them the truth.
 If Nagato doesn't return in probably five more minutes, ¶Haruhi will come aboard, and ¶there won't be a single penny left here.
 We won't even last five minutes. ¶I'm guessing from past data, ¶I think two more minutes is the limit.
 What? ¶Longgate, take the figure and ¶ hurry back to the club room! 
 Understood.
 We'll go too. ¶Mori-san, you saved the day. ¶Thank you.
 No. It's this way that we've been saved. ¶because thanks to you, the confined space won't be as big ¶ Okay, then. ......
 Well, I guess I'm going home, then. ¶This too, for the sake of world peace. ¶Director, please don't hate me! 
 MARK02_02_00
 Asahina-san, have you decided what you're going to bring? ¶Let's go have a little look around. ......
 Hohoho, everyone from the SOS group ¶We're going to participate in the flea market, aren't we?
Yes, sir. ¶ but I don¶t know what to exhibit.
 Do I want a cucumber axe that doesn't stick, ¶ or a carved wooden bear with germanium, ¶ or ......
 (I still don't know if it's that kind of thing ......)
 I don't think any of those things are going to find a buyer.
 Eh!  Really? ¶They're all my favourites, ¶I thought people would want them. ......
 ( No, no, no, only Asahina-san would want them. ¶ No, wait, my sister might want it. ......)
 Hmm? ¶ Isn't that Kyon-kun there?
 Oh, I'm sorry to bother you. ¶I was wondering how Asahina-san was doing, so I came to check on you.
 Thank you, Kyon-kun. ¶I'm sorry for worrying you.
 No problem. ¶So, have you decided what you're going to exhibit?
 That's still up in the air. ......
 Mikuru's only got a bunch of shady TV shopping items.
 Well, maybe you can get someone to buy it for 100 yen or so.
 Hundred yen? ¶Oh, no, it was expensive. ......
 It might be better than no sales, but ¶100 yen won't convince Haruhi. ¶Because I was determined to make money.
 Uuu......¶What am I supposed to do then?
 Pfft... ......
 Oops. Tsuruya-san, that fearless smile. ......
 It's times like this when I come in. ¶There are so many precious treasures lying around in the Tsuruya household that connoisseurs would run away barefoot.
 For the sake of Mikuru who's in trouble, I'll take off a little skin! 
 Really?
 Mikuru Asahina Fan Club, ¶I'll bet on the honour of Single Numbers, ¶I won't let Mikuru be humiliated! 
 But, Tsuruya-san, I don't think it's a good idea to sell expensive items on a flea market that appraisers would run away from. ......
 Don't worry. ¶There's a wide range of treasures.
 I'll find something suitable to sell at the flea market.
 Thank you, Tsuruya-san. ¶I'm so grateful.
 It's too early to thank you.
 Eh?
 I'm not so naive as to offer unconditional goods, no matter how much it's for Mikuru's sake.
 If you want the treasure, you'll have to beat me at mahjong! 
 Hee! 
 So that's how it came to be! 
 Kyon-kun. It's fate that you're here, isn't it? ¶You're in the game too! 
 Well, that's what's going to happen. ...... ¶But we're short one more member.
 Just wait a minute. ¶I'll see what I can find.
 That's an unexpected turn of events, isn't it?
 Yes. I'm sorry, Kyon-kun.
 No, if I can play mahjong with Asahina-san, I'm rather happy.
 Really?
 Of course! 
 Sorry to keep you waiting~. ¶Unfortunately, this is all we had, but ¶Please be patient.
 No dialogue.
 What do you mean, "this thing"? ¶That's Kyon, isn't it? And Asahina-san! 
 Why are you showing up, Taniguchi?
Don't ask me. ¶When I was walking down the corridor, Tsuruya-san suddenly gave me a ¶foot wipe and captured me.
 Poor guy. ......
 Tsuruya-san. ¶I don't know what you think you're doing, but ¶I'm going home! 
 Oh~? Can I go home? ¶I was going to ask you to be my mahjong partner.
 What?
 You're gonna throw away a chance to play mahjong with two pretty girls like these?
 You call yourself a beautiful girl!  ¶You can't say that line unless you have a lot of confidence! 
 What the hell. ¶If that's the case, I'll gladly ¶join in.
 ¶We'll see how brilliant my technique is! 
 Oh, I don't want that.
 Heh?
 This is a contest between me and Mikuru. ¶You're just a headcount,
 You're just a headcount, so just play quietly and don't disrupt the scene.
 What the hell?
 You pathetic bastard. ......
 Come on, Mikuru. Let the games begin. ¶Get the treasure by force! 
 I'll do my best! 
 MARK02_02_01
 I did it - I won.
 Well done, Mikuru!  ¶Well done, you beat me! 
 It's a splendid victory, Asahina-san! 
 That's what I'm talking about, Asahina-san. ¶There's more than just the fact that I'm in love with you! 
 Hey!  ¶If you make a stupid confession in the confusion, ¶the Mikuru Fan Club won't shut up about it! 
 I'm sorry! 
 You idiot!  ......
 Mikuru. As promised, I'll give you the treasure for the flea market.
 I'll call home now and have them bring it to you, so just wait a bit! 
 Yes, yes~.
 Half an hour.
 Sorry to keep you waiting!  ¶This is the treasure I'm giving to Mikuru!  ¶Ja-da-da-da! 
 Oh, wow! 
 First, this picture!  ¶Not known at the moment, but a promising up-and-coming ¶artist drew these paintings.
 Any customer with eyes to see would gladly pile up a wad of cash! 
 It looks like a kindergartener's doodle. ......
 Ohgowawa! 
 There it is!  Tsuruya-ryu Hisshiken (Tsuruya's Special Fist)! 
 Bukubuku......
 Punishment for saying inappropriate things! 
 (A-hwa!  Taniguchi's inappropriate remark¶ If I'd been three seconds later, I'd be like that! )
 It's a kind of heart-warming picture, isn't it?
 As expected of Mikuru!  ¶The essence of the picture is conveyed to those with pure hearts.
 ( Seriously?)
 The second is this!  ¶The deed to the Tsuruya family villa on Mount Osorezan. ¶There's even a weasel who's exclusive to the villa.
 (Flimsy, real estate, huh? ¶ And there's an itako at Mount Osorezan! )
 ¶This is a great deal, even though it's in a slightly inconvenient location.
 ¶ When you're lost in life, the weasel grandmother will give you advice.
 That's reassuring.
 What do you think, Kyung-kun?
 Yes, I do.
 (No, there's no such thing as a holiday home at a flea market!  ¶ Ah, I want to tsukkomi aloud! )
 Thank you, Tsuruya-san. ¶Suzumiya-san will be overjoyed with this.
 You don't have to thank me. ¶See, I can't wait to deliver it to Haru-nyan! 
 Yes~. Kyon-kun, will you help me?
Of course. ¶ Then let's go back to the clubroom! 
 (They can't sell this one. ......¶ Worst case scenario, we might have a closed space. ......¶ Oh, that's depressing.)
 MARK02_02_02
 Huh-uh ......¶ I guess I'm still ¶not up to the task, Mikuru.
 Fueh~n. I've lost! 
 Don't lose heart, Asahina-san! 
 But if I don't beat Tsuruya-san, I won't get the treasure, and Suzumiya-san will be angry with me.
 Don't worry, Mikuru. I'll make sure to prepare the souvenirs for Haru-nyan now.
 What? Are you sure?
 I'll leave it to you. But first, I'll have Mikuru change into a maid's outfit like I promised! 
 ¶Yeah, I didn't promise that!  I didn't promise that! 
 Oh, did I? ¶But, well, the rule of the King's Game is that the loser always obeys the winner! 
 It's not a king's game!  ¶I mean, is that the rule in a game of kings?
 No, it's a game of kings where you write numbers on disposable chopsticks. ......
 You don't have to explain! 
 Come on, Mikuru. I'll quickly change into this maid's uniform! 
 Oh, my gosh!  ¶Kyung-kun, don't look at me! 
 Whoa!  Tsuruya-san!  ¶Wait a minute!  ¶We're going outside! 
 Taniguchi, let's go! 
 Oh, oh! 
 Oh, you scared me. ¶Tsuruya-san looked like Haruhi. ......
 Yeah, that was amazing.
 Hyah!  Oh, no!  ¶I'm so embarrassed! 
 Okay~ You're so cute, Mikuru!  ¶You look great as a maid! 
 ¶Yes, look at me!  ¶Look up a little bit! 
 Like this?
 Yeah, yeah, like that!  ¶You got that look on your face! 
 What the hell is this conversation?
 What the hell is going on in there?
 "Half an hour later."
 Thirty minutes since... ......
 No dialogue.
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Kyon. ¶You can come in.
 Ah, yes. ......
 The other one can go home. ¶You've been a great help to me. ¶Good job! 
 Eh? ¶I want to know what happened to Asahina-san, too.
 I can't help it. ¶Well, let's let you enjoy the beauty of art. Come on! 
 ............
 Ah, Asahina-san!  ¶What's wrong?
 Hauu...... Kyon-kun~.
 Mikuru. You did it well. ¶Laugh more proudly! 
 But~.
 Tsuruya-san!  ¶What were you doing with Asahina-san for the past 30 minutes? ¶What do you mean you finished it?
 Mikuru lost the game with me. ¶That's why I can't hand over the Tsuruya family treasure.
 Instead, I turned Mikuru herself into a treasure with my own hands! 
 I don't understand what you're saying at all. ......
 Look at this! 
 A camera? What's that?
You're a nibbler. ¶ Look at the recorded images.
 Images? Borrow a few from ...... ¶Oh, wow!  ¶This is a lovely shot of Asahina-san in a maid outfit! 
 This is good!  This is great!  ¶I can't get enough of this expression! 
 ¶I'm gonna make a Mikuru Asahina maid photo book with those images and sell it exclusively at flea markets. ¶It's sure to sell like hotcakes! 
 Show it to me, Kyon. ¶Oh, great!  It's gonna burn!  ¶Tsuruya-san, you're also talented with a camera! 
 Of course. ¶I'm the founder of the Tsuruya school of photography.
 ¶I'm beyond amazed at the versatility of this man. ......
 But still, was that Haruhi-like forcefulness you showed earlier for the sake of taking this photo?
 Hmph. I'm sorry Mikuru, but this is also for the sake of art.
 This will sell!  It'll sell!  ¶If it doesn't sell, I'll buy it all! 
 What do you think, Kyon-kun, Mikuru? ¶This will satisfy Haru-nyan, right?
 Yeah. It's sure to be a big hit. ¶She'll be overjoyed.
 ¶I'm so embarrassed about the photo book.
 Be confident, Asahina-san. ¶Your cuteness is world-class! 
 ¶If you use this as an opportunity, you might be scouted by an entertainment production and make your idol debut or something.
 Idol debut? ¶Oh, yeah, that's the way to go! 
 Huh?
 ¶We can't leave material as good as Mikuru in someone else's hands! 
 I'll set up Tsuruya Productions and raise Mikuru Asahina to be a national idol! 
 Mikuru can fill the Budokan ...... or even Tokyo Dome!  Mikuru!  Aim for the top with me! 
 Yes, sir!  ¶Tsuruya producer! 
 Since when is this an idol training game? ¶You've gone too far off the rails! 
 MARK02_02_03a
 ¶Yay, we're at the top!  ¶You've been watching us, Asahina-san! 
 Yes, sir. You were strong.
 Yes, it was strong. ¶Asahina-san praised me! 
 ...... Hey, Taniguchi.
 What the hell, Kyon. ¶You got a recession look on your face. ¶Jealous of my strength?
 No, I'm not. ¶Look at Tsuruya-san's face, not just Asahina-san's.
 Huh? Tsuruya-san?
 ............
 Giggle!  Tsutsu, Tsuruya-san. ¶What the hell is going on?
 ¶Have you forgotten what I said before we started playing?
 Ah! 
 This is a match between me and Mikuru, so ¶I told you to play nice and quiet¶ ......
 Yes, I did!  ¶I was careless! 
 ¶Only Hachibei is allowed to be careless. ¶Ifyoudon'tdo whatI say, I'lljusthaveto punishyou! 
 ¶I'm sorry!  ¶I'm sorry! 
 ¶I've got no choice but to grab another lively one and settle the score! 
 Oh, no. You don't have to do that, it's already settled in the rankings.
Rank? ¶Oh!  If you ask me, that's true.
 I'm lower in the rankings, so I guess I have to admit defeat.
 ¶Even if you don't come out on top, ¶you beat me, Mikuru. ¶You've grown up a lot.
 Congratulations, Asahina-san.
 Thank you. ¶I worked very hard.
 ...... So, as promised, ¶let's present the Tsuruya family treasure.
 I'm so happy. ¶What do I get?
 I'll choose anything I like from here! 
 What's that book as thick as a dictionary?
 It's a gift catalogue. Choose your favourite item, write it on a postcard and send it to me. ¶This time, I'll have it specially sent by express mail! 
 Yay, as you wish.
 Wait, wait a minute. ¶That's not the nature of a flea market. ......
 Don't worry. This is a special catalogue of items no longer needed by the Tsuruya family.
 I see. If that's the case, ......¶ are you making a catalogue of unwanted items? ¶And you have so many of them?
 Wow, beautiful jewellery. ¶Gorgeous dresses, too.
 What the hell? ¶Asahina-san, let me see them too! 
 Here you go.
 Diamond rings, fur coats, ¶A detached house with land! 
 ¶How much is this stuff like rubbish? ¶I mean, you can't sell this stuff at a flea market! 
 ¶In the end, I got the cheapest marble bear. ¶It sold ¶It was left over, though."
 MARK02_02_03b
 ¶Yay, I'm at the top!  ¶You saw it, Asahina-san! 
 Yes. It was strong.
 Yes, it was strong. ¶Asahina-san praised me! 
 ...... Hey, Taniguchi.
 What the hell, Kyon. ¶You got a recession look on your face. ¶Jealous of my strength?
 No, I'm not. ¶Look at Tsuruya-san's face, not just Asahina-san's.
 Huh? Tsuruya-san?
 ............
 Giggle!  Tsutsu, Tsuruya-san. ¶What the hell is going on?
 ¶Have you forgotten what I said before we started playing?
 Ah! 
 This is a match between me and Mikuru, so ¶I told you to play nice and quiet¶ ......
 Yes, I did!  ¶I was careless! 
 ¶Only Hachibei is allowed to be careless. ¶Ifyoudon'tdo whatI say, I'lljusthaveto punishyou! 
 ¶I'm sorry!  ¶I'm sorry! 
 ¶I've got no choice but to grab another lively one and settle the score! 
 Oh, no. You don't have to do that, it's already settled in the rankings.
 Rank? Oh!  I guess you're right.
 I'm ahead of you in the standings, so that means I win, and you get to change into your maid's uniform, like we agreed! 
 ¶Yeah, I didn't promise that!  ¶I didn't promise that! 
 Oh, did I? ¶But, well, the rule of the game of kings is that the loser absolutely obeys the winner! 
It's not a king's game, is it? ¶ Or is that what the rules of the King's Game are?
 Come on, Mikuru. ¶I'll quickly change into this maid's uniform! 
 ¶Yaaaah!  ¶Kyung-kun, don't look at me, yeah! 
 Whoa!  Tsuruya-san!  ¶Wait a minute!  ¶I'm going outside! 
 Oh, you scared me. ¶Tsuruya-san looked like Haruhi. ......
 Hyah!  Oh, no!  ¶I'm so embarrassed! 
 It's okay~ You're cute, Mikuru!  ¶You look great as a maid! 
 ¶Yes, look at me!  ¶Look up a little bit! 
 Like this?
 Yeah, yeah, like that!  ¶You've got that look on your face! 
 What the hell are you two doing?
 Thirty minutes later.
 It's been 30 minutes since then. ......
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Kyon. ¶You may come in.
 Ah, yes. ......
 ............
 Ah, Asahina-san!  ¶What's wrong?
 Hauu...... Kyon-kun~.
 Mikuru. You did it well. ¶Laugh more proudly! 
 But~! 
 Tsuruya-san!  ¶What were you doing with Asahina-san for the past 30 minutes? ¶What do you mean you finished it?
 Mikuru lost the game with me. ¶That's why I can't hand over the Tsuruya family treasure.
 Instead, I turned Mikuru herself into a treasure with my own hands! 
 I don't understand what you're saying at all. ......
 Look at this! 
 A camera? What's that?
 You're a nibbler, aren't you? ¶ Look at the recorded images.
 Images? Borrow a few from ...... ¶Oh, wow!  ¶This is a lovely shot of Asahina dressed as a maid! 
 This is good!  This is amazing!  ¶I can't get enough of this expression! 
 ¶I'm gonna make a Mikuru Asahina maid photo book with those images and sell it exclusively at flea markets. ¶I'm sure it'll sell like hotcakes! 
 That's amazing!  That's amazing, Tsuruya-san!  ¶Is this why you were as forceful as Haruhi earlier?
 Hmph. I'm sorry Mikuru, but this is also for the sake of art.
 I'm so embarrassed about the photo book.
 Depending on how well the maid uniform photo book sells, we'll release a swimming costume photo book in summer, a gym uniform photo book in autumn and a fur photo book in winter.
 Mikuru!  Grab the stars with me! 
 Oh, my dreams are expanding!  ¶No flea market in sight!  ¶This can aim for the world! 
 Pie!  ¶This story's going off in a crazy direction. ¶Please make sure you're on top of it, Kyung~kun! 
 No, this is definitely profitable!  ¶There's no need to be picky, Asahina-san! 
 Hii, I'm afraid of Kyon-kun's eyes~.
 ¶After this, Haruhi joined in and the conversation got even more out of control. ......
 MARK02_02_04
 Okay, I'm on top, aren't I?
 Kyon-kun. I told you this was a match between me and Mikuru. It's meaningless if you come out on top.
 It's not meaningless. ¶I was the challenger too.
 What do you mean?
 ¶Before we started the game, Tsuruya-san said this, right?
If you want the treasure, beat me at mahjong. ¶ Try to get it by force .......
 That's a line I said to Mikuru! 
 Aside from the head-counting Taniguchi, ¶I'm a member of the SOS group, too.
 ¶The game that Asahina-san challenged me to is also my game. ¶That's what friends are for.
 Kyon-kun ......
 ¶In other words, my victory is also Asahina-san's ¶win. ¶So we're entitled to the treasure! 
 Hu ...... ¶You say interesting things.
 But, you know, this battle is only between ¶Me and Mikuru. ¶Whatever you say from the side is invalid! 
 But, Tsuruya, ......
 ¶If you quibble any more, I'll force you to shut your mouth!  ¶Stand there and grit your teeth! 
 Tsuruya-san!  Please calm down!  ¶Kyon is ...... for Asahina-san! 
 If you're covering for him, you're just as guilty as him!  ¶I'll knock you both out together! 
 Kieeeeeeeeee! 
 Aaaaah! 
 Aaah! 
 Aaah. ¶The desks have been cut in half! 
 That's the Tsuruya-style study desk destroying fist. ¶How do you like it? Were you surprised?
 It's amazing.
 Kyon-kun. I was moved by your compassion for Mikuru.
 In recognition of your feelings, I'm going to give you the Tsuruya family treasure. ...... Hey, Kyon-kun?
 ............
 ............
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.
 Oh dear~, maybe I scared them a bit too much. ¶I really wouldn't hit you. ......
 Kyon-kun, I feel sorry for you. ...... ¶I can't believe you fainted. ......
 MARK02_03_00
 Come to think of it, I didn't ask ¶ what Haruhi is going to exhibit. Let's ask her for reference.
 Oh, Kyon. Didn't you go home?
 I wanted to ask you something before I leave.
 What is it?
 What are you going to exhibit?
 I'm not exhibiting anything.
 Huh?
 I'm a divider. ¶How to sell the crap you guys bring to me for the highest price,
 I don't have to put anything up for sale.
 Wait a minute. Isn't that unfair? ¶You're giving us your personal effects and you're not giving us anything.
 You don't understand. ¶I'mnotprovidingthebrains. ¶Then it's a charade.
 What part of ...... is an equivalent exchange?
 ...... I see. ¶Haggling is part of the fun at a flea market, so ¶ don't suddenly offer the lowest price,
 ¶If you start out with a slightly higher price tag ¶is that a good idea?
 Don't you listen to me! 
 Shut up, you're being so picky. ¶I'll bring some used books, too. ¶That's enough. Is that all you've got to say?
 Uh, yeah. ¶What are you going to use the money you raise for? ¶not just buy tea?
 Oh, yeah. ¶Mostly for Mikuru-chan's cosplay outfit.
 Huh?
 Are you deaf? ¶Buy Mikuru-chan's cosplay costume! 
 ¶You're buying that stuff with the money you get from selling the club members' personal belongings! 
That kind of thing is ......¶ You don't understand, Kyon.
 Mikuru-chan's cosplay is a ¶weapon that can be used to get new members! 
 Besides, we can use it when we shoot our new film. ¶I can't think of a more profitable purchase! 
 (Okay, you've got a point, if you ask me. ...... ¶ No, wait, have you ever had a cosplay fail before?
 Besides, can we approve of Haruhi's ¶ self-decided usage without consulting us?)
 What's with that face? You seem to be trying to say something.
 Yeah. About the use of the activity funds. ......
 MARK02_03_01
 It's not a bad idea. ¶Asahina-san's cosplay is certainly eye-catching. ¶It could be used to attract customers.
 Right? Hey, how about this? ¶I found it online the other day.
 Let's see. ...... ¶ Whoa!  This is ...... too extreme. ¶It's a costume I can't show you! 
 No dialogue.
 What about this one?
 You want me to put this on Asahina-san? ¶I'm tempted to run just imagining it¶ Don't resist the urge ......
 Pfft... ...... ¶Kyon, you like it too.
 ¶You're the one who knows what men like,...... ¶I won't get in! 
 You're on board!  ......
 And anyway!  ¶I can't let Asahina-san wear such an erotic costume.
 ¶You forgot the time you got a big eye roll for the bunny girl cosplay! 
 Oh, that's happened to you too. ......
 Too extreme is not good for Asahina-san, nor for the ¶SOS group.
 I'm not against cosplay per se, so ¶I'm asking you to choose moderation.
 Okay, okay. ¶But, you know, if the items don't sell at the flea market, ¶I can't buy a costume or anything,
 ¶bring something you know you can sell.
 Yeah, I'll take care of it.
 I'll look into the strategy so that we can increase the sales by a penny.
 I'm counting on you. Well, I'm going home first.
 ...... Hey, Kyon.
 Hm?
 Let's do our best at the flea market! 
 Oh, oh! 
 MARK02_03_02
 Don't spend everyone's money on that. ¶You say plausible things like that to get members or for the film,
 But isn't cosplay your personal hobby?
 That's so rude. ¶It's not a hobby! 
 ¶I'm seriously considering the development of the SOS Squad, ¶and cosplaying¶ as a means to that end! 
 Yeah, you're right. ¶You're trying to promote the existence of the SOS Squad.
 ¶I remember you once dressed up as a bunny girl and handed out leaflets. ¶What happened as a result?
 Ugh. ......
 The flea market thing is a boat I'm getting on, and ¶ I can give you a hand to get funding for your activities.
 But the cosplay costumes should only be bought after ¶ prior discussion and ¶ approval by all the members.
 The money we raise this time is the money we get from selling our personal items! 
 Hmm. ¶That's what they're going to tell us.
 Hey, what the hell. ......
 ¶If you're going to be that high and mighty, ¶you're going to offer us a treasure ¶that we can make a tidy sum of money from, aren't you?
What?
 You're not just going to bring a piece of junk that's only worth 100 or 200 yen, are you?
 Giggle! 
 I'm looking forward to seeing what amazing treasures you'll bring tomorrow. ¶Then, after you! 
 ¶I was going to muddy the tea with some old manga or something, but that's not going to happen anymore. ¶I shouldn't have gone against Haruhi. ......
 MARK02_03_03
 Can't you think of another use for it?
 What do you mean, other uses?
 For example, buying our own computer and returning the one we robbed from the ¶Competition Lab. ......
 Dismissed!  Anything else?
 You're rejecting it immediately? ¶Then buy a book about your favourite aliens or ¶psychics or ......
 I can go to the library to read a book. Dismissed! 
 ¶Then you could go and interview a ¶great scholar who studies aliens.
 You'd have to pay for transportation, and you'd have to bring a pastry or something, wouldn't you?
 Oh, that sounds interesting. ¶That's a nice idea for Kyung's brain to come up with.
 You can either praise or scorn it.
 I see, there are other ways to use the money besides cosplay.
 ¶I've been so narrow-minded in trying to balance my hobby and my practical interests.
 (Hobbies and practical interests ...... ¶ So that's what you were really thinking after all.)
 If Kyon can come up with an idea like this, ¶If Yuki and Kozumi-kun can lend their wisdom, ¶I'm sure we can come up with a better idea.
 ¶When the flea market is over, ¶let's all have a meeting about how to invest the activity funds.
 You've reconsidered! 
 But, you know, if we don't sell any items at the flea market, ¶we won't be able to raise any money, so make sure you bring something you can sell.
 I'll look into ¶ strategies so that I can increase my sales by even a penny.
 I'll take good care of it. ¶But don't expect too much from what I bring.
 I don't have any treasures that an enthusiast would pay good money for.
 Don't worry. ¶I'll sell it to you hand over fist! 
 Just don't try anything fraudulent. ¶Then I'm leaving.
 Good luck at the flea market! 
 Oh! 
 MARK02_04_00
 Let's go out on the roof and watch the sunset in style. ......
 A little early for sunset, isn't it? ...... ¶ Hmm? ¶Isn't that the head of the Compi Lab over there?
 Oh, shit!  ¶You already know where he is!  ¶Fear not, SOS Squad! 
 What? What the hell are you talking about?
 Don't play dumb!  You're after the game software and goods from the Compilation Lab too, aren't you?
 Ah, come to think of it, Haruhi gave Nagato ¶such an order.
 Nagato-san told me to offer you the treasure, and when I refused, the Commander came barging in and tried to take it away by force.
 ¶That's why I fled here for my life, ¶I didn't expect to be found so soon! 
 I'm not gonna let them get me! 
 Wait!  ¶I'm not working for Haruhi! 
 What?
 I'm a victim too. ¶Suddenly, I'm at a flea market and I'm ordered to bring my personal belongings ¶ and I'm made to say OK with or without ......
 You too?
Yeah. ¶So I'm not trying to catch you. ¶I rather pity you.
 Well, well, ......¶ then you're safe here.
 ¶What the hell does your Commander think he's doing? ¶What does he think the Comp Lab is?
 I don't know. I have no idea. ¶If you know what he's thinking, ¶I'd love to be his friend.
 Damn. ......
 But one thing is obvious.
 What the hell?
 ¶Haruhi's probably doing whatever he wants in the clubroom now that you're gone.
 Ah!  ¶I ran away unintentionally because I felt I was in danger, but ¶she was after the treasure of the Kompiken! 
 ¶There probably isn't a single pennywort left in the clubroom.
 But even if you had stayed, ¶ the result would have been the same, so I think it's a good thing you secured your own safety.
 No, maybe it's not too late now!  ¶What I should have done was not to run away, ¶I should have fought! 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! 
 Sir. I'm touched by your courage. ¶Please ...... please survive! 
 MARK02_05_00
 No, let's just go home as soon as we can. ¶I'm usually made to ¶play mahjong with my mahjong partner until dark. ......
 Hmm? Isn't that Furuizumi?
 Hmm? ¶You're home very early.
 That's our line. ¶Is the confined space cleared out yet?
 Yeah. Very easily. ¶It's as if you didn't fight.
 That's why you came back so quickly.
 Perhaps Suzumiya-san's dissatisfaction has been resolved.
 I found it!  Kyon! 
 Hm?
 Hahaha ......¶ I looked for you, Kyon. ¶You were with Furui too, weren't you?
 No, I just bumped into Furui here. ......¶ That's right, what's going on? ¶Such a rush.
 Good news!  ¶I got the treasure! 
 Treasure?
 ¶I got a bunch of rare video game stuff from the Competitive Research Institute.
 ¶some limited edition figures that are being sold on the internet auctions at very high prices! 
 If we put them on the flea market, we'll have enough money to fund our activities! 
 That's great.
 Now, we need to go back to the clubroom and work out a sales strategy for how high we're going to sell that thing. ¶Then I'm expecting your treasures, too! 
 That was a hell of a high-tension moment.
 I could see why the closed space was so easily cleared out. ¶You've solved the problem of funding your activities.
 Now it's up to us to help you raise as much revenue as possible.
 Yes, we will. ¶But did you get the treasure from the Competitiveness Institute in a friendly way?
 Do you think it's so easy ¶ to get valuable treasure given away?
 Right. ¶I don't know exactly how, but ¶I bet they took it in a rough way.
 I feel sorry for the Competitive Research Institute, too. ......
 MARK03_00_00
 Lorne!  ¶Here, here, here, take it off quickly!  ¶Don't be jittery! 
 ¶Oh, look at you, when you take it off ¶you have a beautiful body.
Hey, Haruhi. ¶I don¶t think it¶s a good idea for high school girls to play undressing mahjong games.
 Eh, I don't think it's a good idea! 
 Huh? ¶This is an insect mahjong game. ¶If you lose, your opponent's insect moults.
 See, it's a beautiful butterfly, isn't it?
 Yes, it's a beautiful butterfly.
 It's confusing!  ¶¶ I mean, you're too much of a maniac! 
 Because of the mahjong boom, a lot of ¶mahjong games have appeared recently.
 In addition to insect mahjong, there's animal mahjong, fantasy mahjong and football mahjong. ¶Oh yeah, there's also Go Mahjong.
 What the hell kind of mahjong is that? ¶There's too much diversification! 
 Don't get me started. ¶I didn't come up with it.
 Yeah, well, that's true, too. ¶Sorry.
 ...... But usually at times like this, ¶Nagato or Koizumi can give us an explanation, but ¶are they both gone today?
 Both of them said they had something to do today, so they just showed up at the club room and left already.
 Furuyumi-kun sometimes disappears on urgent business, but it's unusual for Yuki to be on an errand.
 Nagato-san said she was going to Tsuruya Department Store to see the ESP show.
 ¶Nagato-san must really like it if she's going by herself.
 But it's raining today. ¶I wonder if they'll put on a show on the roof.
 Sure. ¶If it rains this hard, it'll be cancelled.
 I said so, too, but ¶I said it might miraculously rain out. ......
 You're very enthusiastic. ...... ¶By the way, what kind of errand did Furuizumi say he was on?
 He said he was going to buy a game.
 Ah, a game?
 ( There's nothing unusual about Haruhi's condition. ¶ It doesn't seem to be a closed space.)
 Both Yuki and Furuizumi-kun have important plans for today. ......
 Important plans? ¶What's going on?
 We're having an SOS group karaoke contest. ¶Sometimes we forget about mah-jongg and have a karaoke party! 
 Wait a minute. ¶I didn't hear any plans like that.
 I don't know either.
 That's right, you don't. ¶We just decided.
 Just now?
 Yeah. ¶I was going to tell everyone now.
 You know, that's not a plan!  ¶It's called an idea! 
 Shut up. ¶Even if it's an idea, ¶the Commander made the decision, ¶the members should follow it! 
 You're too selfish! 
 Mikuru!  ¶You're going to take part in the karaoke competition, aren't you?
 No, no, Mairou-do! 
 ¶Since Kyon has no veto power, ¶just now, the holding of the karaoke contest has gone from ¶scheduled to a done deal! 
 No veto, huh? ¶I had a feeling that was the case! 
 Well then, Kyung. ¶Reserve a karaoke bar in front of the station right now! 
 Then find Yuki and Furuizumi-kun and bring them to the ¶karaoke shop! 
 Can you do it all at once?
Move your body while you complain!  ¶Hurry! 
 ¶Shut up! 
 Excuse me! 
 Who's there?
 Suddenly, I need you to play mahjong with me! 
 Mr. Director of the Kompi Lab! 
 We of the Kompi Lab have been boiled over and over by the SOS-dan, and have spent our days in fear of the shadow of Haruhi Suzumiya.
 But those days of humiliation are over today!  ¶I will win at mahjong and win my freedom!  ¶Suzumiya-kun!  Will you accept this match! 
 All right.
 Heh? You sure?
 Huh? ¶You forcefully challenged me to a match yourself ¶ What are you talking about?
 Oh, no. ¶I didn't expect you to accept so readily¶ ......
 I'll at least accept a game of mahjong. ¶I'm gonna win anyway.
 But if you want to play, we'll play tomorrow. ¶I'm in the mood for karaoke today.
 What? Tomorrow? Karaoke? ¶ Um, I'd like you to play ¶ today, if you can. ......
 I can't do that. ¶Come back tomorrow. ¶then I'll be happy to play.
 Oh, no!  ¶You know how determined and passionate I was to give you a fight?
 I want a fight now, not tomorrow. ......
 You're persistent!  ¶When I say tomorrow, it's tomorrow! 
 Ugh. ......
 Kyung!  ¶I'm heading to the karaoke bar now.
 ¶IfI haven't made a reservation by the time I get there, you're on the hook for the fee! 
 Come on, karaoke, karaoke! 
 Wait a minute!  ¶You're too selfish, Haruhi! 
 Damn it!  You want me to make a reservation first? ¶I'm at your mercy?
 But if I don't make a reservation, that guy's really gonna make me pay for it. ......
 ¶Yeah, hold on!  ¶Harsh!  Let's talk! 
 Ah, Kyon-kun! 
 Noooooo!  ¶Ignore me and don't go to karaoke!  ¶What should I do with my raised fist?
 MARK03_01_00
 How fast did that Haruhi guy go to the karaoke bar?
 Well, I called the shop, so I don't have to worry about them complaining later.
 What I'm more worried about is Asahina-san. ¶I'm sure the head of the Competitive Research Institute will tease her for failing to escape.
 I have to go help her. ......
 Please don't do that. ¶Please forgive me.
 No dialogue.
 You're going to have to fight me!  ¶I don't care who you are!  You're gonna have to fight me! 
 Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! 
 Please don't!  ¶Asahina-san's crying, aren't you?
 Kyon-kun! 
 I've come to the right place!  ¶Come on, play with me!  ¶I came here for that! 
 What, what's this disastrous aura force? ¶Your obsession with the game has taken over this man's mind¶
 Come on, you've got to win!  ¶Or I'll call it a no-win situation and you'll get your computer back! 
 ¶IfI do that, ¶I wonder what kind of punishment Haruhi will give me. ......
All right. ¶It seems that the only way to keep you docile is to beat you at mahjong.
 Let's take this match! 
 Okay!  Will you fight me?
 Asahina-san. ¶Will you fight with me?
 Ha, yes. ¶If you fight, Kyon-kun. ......
 but three of us are no match for you. ¶What about one more person? ......
 Can't we call the Commander back?
 That guy's in the middle of a joyous song right now. ¶If we interrupt that, our lives are in danger.
 Oh, yeah?
 Wait a minute. ¶I have an idea who the men are, so I'll call them up.
 Hello? Kunikida? ¶Can you come to the SOS squad room now? ¶We're short on mahjong menz.
 This is your chance to show your presence. I'll be waiting.
 How'd you find us?
 Yeah, I did. ¶I was pleased, so I'll be at ...... in five minutes.
 Hey, Kyung. ¶Thanks for calling me.
 Huh!  ¶How hungry are you for a cue?
 Now we've got the men. ¶So let's get this game started! 
 MARK03_01_01
 We won, we're on top.
 You did it, Asahina-san! 
 Thanks to Kyon-kun fighting with us.
 Ba, you idiot!  ¶My persistence shouldn't be like this. ¶There's no way I'm going to be defeated in front of the Hira club members! 
 I don't know what your obsession is, but ¶that's how good you are.
 ¶Before you burn with the obsession of overthrowing Haruhi, ¶polish your mahjong skills even more.
 Oh, man, let me tell you, ...... ¶My skills are even better!  ¶That was just a bad tone! 
 Let's play one more game!  ¶This time I'm gonna beat you guys, and then I'm gonna let the pent-up resentment ......
 Enough of that! 
 Ooo-ryaaaah! 
 No dialogue.
 Geez! 
 I waited forever for Momikuru-chan to come, so I came to see how she was doing and ...... ¶I didn't realize it had come to this.
 It's not fair, Haruhi Suzumiya, ...... ¶It's not fair to start from behind. ......
 Which one of you is the coward? ¶While I was away at karaoke, you attacked the weak Mikuru and one other person! 
 What other one? ¶At least say "Kyung.
 I shouldn't have let you run away from the game with me! 
 I told you we're playing tomorrow, didn't I? ¶You should hold out for at least one day! 
 My obsession with the match was on the verge of exploding!  ¶I can't wait an hour! 
 How selfish of me. ...... ¶But you've won the match, haven't you?
 Yes. I won.
 Well done, Mikuru. ¶That you can't even beat Mikuru-chan shows how little you know about persistence! 
 I've already told you that. ......
 Shut up about the other one! 
 So call me by name! 
 The head of the Competitive Research Institute. ¶If you lost to Mikuru, ¶you'll never beat me.
 That means you lost to me! 
 That's absurd!  ¶You can't tell the difference until you try! 
 Maybe you're right. ¶But you couldn't wait just one day and you blew your chance to beat me.
To such a pusillanimous, stupid man¶ the Goddess of Victory will never smile on you! 
 Ugh! 
 It seems you've realised. It seems you've realized your defeat ......
 I wanted ...... to win ...... against Haruhi Suzumiya.
 I don't know what it is, but it looks like ¶Haruhi won.
 Now that you've conceded defeat, ¶I'll have you punished accordingly.
 Eh?
 ¶All expenses for the karaoke competition, all expenses paid. ¶All right?
 Okay. ......
 I easily OK'd it!  ¶The director's heart is completely broken! 
 Come on, guys. ¶we're going back to the karaoke bar! 
 Oh, um, what do I do ......
 Who the hell are you?
 Ugh!  Ku, we're classmates. ...... ¶Kyung, I'm leaving. ......
 Sorry, Kunikida. ......
 Okay, let's start the SOS-karaoke contest! 
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 I've been waiting for you!  Yeah, yeah! 
 What? ¶ Why are you here?
 I called you. ¶The more people, the merrier, right?
 That's true, but did you come all the way here by yourself?
 ¶I asked Mr. Niikawa to pick me up.
 Thanks. ¶I'm a taxi driver who comes as soon as you call.
 Oh, wow!  Even Mr. Niikawa! 
 Don't worry about the taxi fare, the head of the Compi Lab will ¶pay it. ¶Right, Mr Director?
 Yes. ......
 (Mr Director, don't let them suck you down to the bone. ¶ Poor little thing. ......)
 Come on, ¶ Mikuru-chan, you're the top batsman! 
 Hee!  ¶Do, why me?
 ¶Because you're the one who took down the Kompi Kengen. ¶You're the one who came out on top. ¶You deserve to be the top batter! 
 Thank you. ¶So, I'm gonna sing "Ee-so Ippatsu Tsumo! " ¶Singing.
 You're good, Mikuru. ¶You've chosen the latest hit! 
~ ¶Although you always apologize for your smut...
 Hmm. That's Asahina-san. ¶The way you sing is also outstandingly cute! 
~ ¶Suso fluttering skirt fluttering dance~ ¶My heart's pounding in my chest goes a ton~
 Oh, God, I can't stand it!  ¶I'll sing too! 
 What?
~ ¶I want to show you~ ¶my spunky heart~
 Hey, hey!  ¶What are you gonna do when you're the leader?
~ ¶I hid a secret word in my heart~ ¶I'll be an ee-so~! 
 No, I can't stop now!  ¶Good grief, you're too selfish as usual! 
 ¶You're too selfish as usual!  ¶You're too selfish as usual! 
 MARK03_01_02
 Ha-ha-ha!  ¶You see, my power!  ¶Hail, CompiKen!  Ha-ha-ha! 
 Well, I've lost.
 I didn't know his persistence was this strong. ...... ¶It's frustrating, but we lost! 
 I see you've conceded defeat, Mr Hilla club member. ¶And as proof of our victory, we'll ask you to return the set of computers you took from us! 
What?
 No, no!  ¶Suzumiya-san's going to get mad at me.
 That's great. ¶If Suzumiya-kun gets angry, she'll challenge me to a fight.
 That's exactly what I want!  ¶I'll defeat Suzumiya-kun, who's lost her cool, with my own hands! 
 This person is serious! 
 Now, get out of the way. ¶That computer's ours! 
 No, no!  Get out of the way! 
 You're a stubborn man. Get your hands off me! 
 No, no, no! 
 Ah, Asahina-san! 
 What?
 I got your picture.
 So, that voice is ...... Suzumiya-kun?
 'Compi Lab head attacks female student again! ' ¶ How about a headline like that?
 ¶ I'll put it alongside the previous photo and leaflet it all over the school.
 No!  ¶This is just an attempt to get the computer back! 
 ¶All the pictures show is a perverted head of the department coming on to a disgusted Mikuru-chan, okay? ¶Nobody's going to believe that excuse.
 Ugh. ......
 Mikuru-chan, come here.
 Haiii......
 Thank you, Mikuru-chan. ¶You tried to protect the computer with your body.
 Ryuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu. Uuuuuu......
 Alrighty......
 Haruhi. ¶You went to the karaoke bar, didn't you?
 I did go. ¶But no matter how long I waited, Momikuru-chan didn¶t come, so I came to check on her.
 So, how did you end up in this mess?
 Actually, it's not so simple as it seems. ......
 ¶While I was away at karaoke, you challenged me to a game and tried to steal my computer back. ¶What a weaselly man.
 ¶I didn't want to do this. ¶You shouldn't have run away from the game with me! 
 I told you we're playing tomorrow. ¶You're just gonna have to hold out for one day! 
 My obsession with the game was on the verge of exploding!  ¶I can't wait an hour! 
 Impatient man. ¶But because of your impatience, ¶you lost the game.
 You idiot!  I came out on top!  ¶I won! 
 Hmm. ¶I don't care if they spread pictures of me attacking Mikuru all over the school. ......
 Oh, ......
 It doesn't matter where you rank. ¶You lost because they took pictures that can't be published.
 Ugh! 
 Looks like you've come to your senses. ¶You've lost ......
 Damn. I ...... lost.
 Haruhi won. ¶In a familiar way ......
 Now that you've conceded defeat, ¶you'll be sanctioned accordingly.
 Huh?
 All expenses paid for the karaoke competition. ¶All right?
 Wow, okay. ......
 Come on, guys. ¶we're going back to the karaoke bar! 
 Oh, um, what do I do ......
 Who the hell are you?
 Ugh!  Ku, we're classmates. ...... ¶Kyung, I'm leaving. ......
 Sorry, Kunikida. ......
 Okay, let's start the SOS-karaoke contest! 
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 I've been waiting for you!  Yeah, yeah! 
 What? ¶Why are you here?
I called them. ¶The more people, the merrier, right?
 That's true, but did you come all the way here alone?
 I asked Mr. Niikawa to ¶pick me up.
 Thanks. ¶I'm a taxi driver who comes as soon as you call.
 Oh, wow!  Even Mr. Niikawa! 
 Don't worry about the taxi fare, because the head of the Compi Lab will ¶pay it. ¶Right, Mr Director?
 Yes. ......
 (Mr Director, don't let them suck you down to the bone. ¶ Poor little thing. ......)
 Okay, then, the top batsman is you, Mr Director.
 What? Me?
 You won the top prize in the game earlier, didn't you? ¶That's why I got the top prize.
 So, Suzumiya-kun, ...... you're ......
 Instead, you're only allowed to sing this one song.
 ¶I was a fool to think you were kind, even for a moment! 
 Come on, get on with it and sing. ¶Everyone's waiting for you.
 All right, all right. ¶So, I'm gonna sing "Be the Wind in the East"¶
 That's a very astringent choice of music. ......
~ ¶After my ~reach~ ¶ please don't ring
 Oh! 
 You're good!  ¶I can't imagine a professional singing voice like that from you, Haruhi, who's always getting beat up! 
 Amazing.
~ ¶Urasadora is on the east wind~ ¶Urasadora is on the east wind~
 Damn. That's not funny. ¶You're a beaten character, but you can sing well,
 That kind of unexpectedness isn't required in this game! 
 Hey, Haruhi. ¶You're lucky we didn't have a karaoke competition. ¶This would've wiped out the SOS Squad.
 Shut up! 
 Goha!  ¶Ko, I hate this kind of punchline. ......
 Ah, Kyung-kun!  ¶Please pull yourself together, Kyon-kun~! 
 MARK03_01_03a
 ¶Yay, I'm the top. ¶It was worth all the hard work.
 ............
 ............
 Huh? What's wrong with you guys? ¶Bitterly ......
 Hira club member, you. ¶Doesn't your friend know ¶what it means to read the air?
 Excuse me. I didn't expect this guy to ¶top it.
 I thought he was an air-reader. ...... ¶I didn't buy it.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Was it wrong for me to win?
 Hey, Kunikida. ¶This time it's a showdown between the Kompiken and the SOS team.
 If you, an outsider, win, the game won't be settled! 
 But I told you it's a chance to show your presence! 
 Listen, supporting actors have a presence that's appropriate for supporting actors. ¶If a comedian gets too far ahead, he'll be hung out to dry, right?
 It's professional to show your presence when you know your place.
 Kyung. I seem to have misunderstood the concept of presence. I'm sorry.
 You just have to understand. ¶So, Mr. Director. How do you want to settle this one?
Normally, I would have liked to decide in a rematch, but ¶ after playing one game, the ¶ urge to play mahjong ¶ has subsided.
 Let's settle it this time by the ranking of Asahina-kun and me.
 That means ......
 I win, soooo.
 I'm sorry, but this time I lose. ¶Let's withdraw meekly.
 But today's fight is just a prelude. ¶The real battle is tomorrow's fight against Suzumiya-kun.
 ¶Winning that battle, ¶I'll open up the future of the Kompinken! 
 Well then, gentlemen, I'll see you again!  ¶Ahaha......
 You're walking away like a 20-faced monster.
 He's kind of creepy. ......
 ¶Has your obsession with Haruhi changed your character?
 Oops, it's from Haruhi. ¶...... Hello?
 How long are you making me wait? ¶We can't start the karaoke competition unless you and Mikuru-chan come! 
 Come here in three minutes!  ¶If you don't show up, it's all on Kyon! 
 Wait, I can't give you 3 minutes, I've gone past ....... ¶Asahina-san, Haruhi's furious, let's go to the karaoke bar.
 No dialogue.
 Yes, sir.
 Hey, can I go home? ¶I took the top spot and this is how I'm treated. ...... ¶I feel like Taniguchi. ...... Gusun.
 MARK03_01_03b
 Yay, I'm the top. ¶It was worth the steady work.

 Let's settle it this time by the ranking of Asahina-kun and me.
 That means ......
 I guess I win.
 I'm sorry to say, but it seems so. ......
 Then, let's have you return the ¶computer you took from the Competitive Research Institute! 
 Hiiii! 
 I'd like to say ......, but ¶I'm not qualified to say that since I didn't take the top spot.
 ¶I'm not qualified to say that. ¶But today's battle is just a prelude. ¶The real fight is tomorrow against Suzumiya-kun.
By winning that battle, ¶ I will open up the future of the Competitive Research Institute! 
 Well, gentlemen, I'll see you soon!  ¶ahaha......
 You're walking away like a 20-faced monster.
 He's kind of creepy. ......
 ¶Has your obsession with Haruhi changed your character?
 Oops, it's from Haruhi. ¶...... Hello?

 MARK03_01_04
 I won, didn't I?
 Kyon-kun, you're so cool! 
 Me, I worked hard for Asahina-san! 
 Ba, you idiot!  ¶My persistence shouldn't be like this. ¶There's no way I'm losing in front of the Hira club members! 
 I don't know what your obsession is, but ¶that's how good you are.
 ¶Before you burn with the obsession of overthrowing Haruhi, ¶polish your mahjong skills even more.
 Oh, man, let me tell you, ...... ¶My skills are even better!  ¶That was just a bad tone! 
 Let's play one more game!  ¶This time I'm gonna beat you guys, and then I'm gonna let the pent-up resentment ......
 Enough of that! 
 Ooo-ryaaaah! 
 Geez! 
 ¶I waited forever for Momikuru-chan to come, so I came to see how she was doing, but ¶I didn't realize it had come to this.
 ¶It's not fair to kick her from behind. ......
 Which one of you is a coward? ¶While I was away at karaoke, ¶you attacked weak Mikuru and one other person! 
 What do you mean "the other one"? ¶At least say "Kyung.
 I shouldn't have let you run away from the game with me! 
 I told you we're playing tomorrow. ¶You should hold out for at least one day! 
 My obsession with the match was on the verge of exploding!  ¶I can't wait an hour! 
 How selfish of me. ...... ¶ But you've won the game, haven't you?
 Yeah, I'm on top.
 That's pretty good for one other person. ¶Totally, you can't even beat one other person. ¶Your persistence is pathetic! 
 So call me by name! 
 Head of the Competitive Research Unit. ¶You lost to Kyon, not ...... the other one, which means you'll never win against me.
 That means you lost to me! 
 That's absurd!  ¶You can't know the game until you try! 
 Maybe you're right. ¶But you couldn't wait just one day and you blew your chance to beat me.
 ¶Victory never smiles on such an irascible, stupid man! 
 Ugh! 
 It seems you've come to your senses. You've realised your defeat. ......
 I wanted ...... to win ...... against Haruhi Suzumiya.
 I don't know what it is, but it looks like ¶Haruhi won.
 Now that you've conceded defeat, ¶I'll have you punished accordingly.
 Huh?
Karaoke competitions, all expenses paid. ¶ Okay?
 Okay. ......
 I easily OK'd it!  ¶The director's heart is completely broken! 
 Come on, guys. ¶we're going back to the karaoke bar! 
 Oh, um, what do I do ......
 Who the hell are you?
 Ugh!  Ku, we're classmates. ...... ¶Kyung, I'm leaving. ......
 Sorry, Kunikida. ......
 Okay, let's start the SOS-karaoke contest! 
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 I've been waiting for you!  Yeah, yeah! 
 What? ¶ Why are you here?
 I called you. ¶The more people, the merrier, right?
 That's true, but did you come all the way here by yourself?
 ¶I asked Mr. Niikawa to pick me up.
 Thanks. ¶I'm a taxi driver who comes as soon as you call.
 Oh, wow!  Even Mr. Niikawa! 
 Don't worry about the taxi fare, because the head of the Compi Lab will ¶pay it. ¶Right, Mr Director?
 Yes. ......
 (Mr Director, don't let them suck you down to the bone. ¶ Poor little thing. ......)
 Come on, Kyung, top bats, ¶ I'll let you sing.
 Well, of course. ¶I'm the one who came out on top in the earlier game, ¶I deserve to sing first.
 Well, then, I'll do my number eighteen ......
 That's not gonna happen! 
 Gosh! 
 Oh! 
 ¶A special kick with a lighter weight and a twist ¶increased destructive power. ¶This works.
 I'm not calmly commentating on this! 
 You've still got some energy left in you. ¶I'm gonna give you another one! 
 Whoaaaaah!  ¶Now, why are you doing this to my brother? ......
 I'm the first one to sing. I'm the last one to sing. ¶I won't give up my top billing and my spot as tri! 
 This sister's obsession with singing ...... is real. ¶Amazing, even for my own sister. ......
 Yay!  ¶Itsshoottaimu! 
 MARK03_02_00
 Hey, Kyung!  ¶Why is it just you and me?
 Did you call everyone to let them know we're having a karaoke contest?
 Look, everyone has their own plans. ¶I just thought of a karaoke competition, ¶I can't just show up right away.
 I mean, if you want to sing so badly, why don't you just sing by yourself?
 I don't want to. It's not gonna be fun if Kyung's the only one listening.
 Why not? ¶I'm disqualified as an audience member?
 Oh, God, I don't have time for this. ¶Yeah, Kyung, can you give me a shoulder rub? ¶Lately, my shoulders are really stiff.
 I've been playing so much mah-jongg, I haven't been exercising.
 I don't know!  ¶I'm not a masseuse! 
 What? Stingy. ¶This is the perfect opportunity to flatter the Commander.
 Who's gonna flirt with you?
 Hey, Haru-nyan. ¶I came to sing too! 
 Huh? ¶Why are you here?
I called them. ¶It's better to have as many participants as possible, right?
 Thank you for inviting me, Hal. ¶On the other hand, you're a heartless brother DEATH for keeping such a fun thing a secret! 
 I'm telling you, I was forced to come along. ¶I didn't join in the fun! 
 But, little sister, you were so quick. ¶It's only been about five minutes since I called you, right?
 ¶Yeah. ¶A taxi pulled up in front of the house and Uncle gave me a lift here.
 Oh, good for you.
 Wait a minute!  ¶A taxi stopped in front of my house and Uncle gave me a lift?
 Isn't that kidnapping? ¶Who's this Uncle?
 ¶If it's Uncle, he's outside my room. ¶Uncle! 
 Heh?
 Hi. ¶I'm Uncle-chan, a taxi driver passing by.
 Oh, Mr. Niikawa? ¶You're Uncle ......?
 Yes. ¶I'm not a kidnapper or anything like that.
 I'm sorry!  ¶I didn't know, I just ......
 ¶I happened to be passing by your house, ¶I saw your sister, ¶I just called out to her,
 ¶I heard that you were going to karaoke now, so I had to ask for your help.
 We'll only charge you for the first ride.
 You're taking money? ¶There's no more polite way to say ¶Okaraoke¶! 
 ¶Thank you for your sharp point of view.
 You didn't actually happen to be passing by, did you?
 Yes, sir. ¶I went to pick up your sister from her late arrival frustration ¶ to avoid creating a closed space.
 I knew it. ¶Because you wouldn't happen to pass by my house ......
 Haru-nya-nya-nya. ¶Let's start the karaoke competition! 
 No, little sister. There's still not enough cheers. ¶Only in front of a large audience does my performance shine at its best! 
 What the hell are you talking about? ......
 ¶So let's pass the time playing Mahjong until the others get here.
 What?
 There's four of us, so it's perfect.
 Wait a minute. Mr. Niikawa's at work. ¶You can't just count me as a member.
 Oh, it's fine, isn't it, Mr. Niikawa?
 Yes, of course.
 I said yes easily!  ¶But my sister's still in primary school. ¶I don't know the rules of mahjong ......
 You know? ¶It's a mahjong boom, ¶It's embarrassing not to know.
 (Yes, that's how the world was. ......)
 Well, then, let's get started. ¶It's a good thing I brought my console.
 Hey, Haruhi. ¶If we're going to play mahjong here, ¶the challenge from the Competitive Research Institute earlier, ¶you could've taken it, couldn't you?
 It's okay, that thing. ¶Come on, let's go! 
 That thing is ......
 MARK03_02_01
 Well, that's roughly how it went.
 Hal, you're so cool! 
 ¶I'm called the Perfect Queen because I don't cut corners even when it comes to killing time.
 When did anyone call me the Perfect Queen?
I just called you that just now!  ¶Eh heh heh heh! 
 Don't fluff up your nonsense! 
 I'm late~! 
 Moo~, you're late, Mikuru-chan! 
 The head of the Compilation Lab was so persistent, ¶I couldn't leave the clubroom... ......
 What? ¶He's got some nerve making a pass at Mikuru-chan.
 I'll beat him to a pulp in tomorrow's match, and use him as my servant for the rest of my life! 
 ¶I'm not being wooed, ¶I'm going to ...... for a mahjong match.
 Arrival.
 You finally arrived, Yuki! 
 What happened to the squadron show, Nagato-san?
 Cancelled due to rain. ¶I'm sorry I didn't get to meet the Bearded Mask.
 Bearded Mask? Then here it is: ......
 Whoo-hoo! 
 What?
 ¶That's tactless to reveal the identity of your hero.
 Oh, ......
 Don't destroy a child's dream. ¶Keep this matter confidential.
 Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
 (Whether Nagato is a child or not, ¶ That was certainly tactless. (Let's reflect on that.)
 What about the bearded mask?
 Uh, oh. ¶I was going to say there's another fan here. ¶I've been into the Bearded Mask lately, too.
 I'm glad you're a fellow .......
 Next time you go to a show, invite me.
 ¶Yeah, I will. Will do.
 Sorry I'm late. ¶I got carried away looking for my hobby game.
 It's unusual for you to be last. ¶You know the rules of the SOS Squad, don't you?
 Penalty ...... for being late, right? ¶I'm ready.
 I like your grace. ¶That's a far cry from someone else.
 Sorry, not graceful! 
 ¶So, now that we're all here, ¶ let's start the SOS Squad karaoke competition! 
 I've been waiting for you!  Yeah, yeah! 
 ¶I'm the leader, I'll be the first one to go.
 Good luck~.
 What song shall we play?
 Put "Winter Swallows Back".
 Do enka ......
 It's a big hit song at the moment.
 Can you sing enka?
 Of course. ¶I'll make the audience tremble! 
 It's started~. Crackle crackle crackle ......
~ ¶Two years of mountains piled up with you ¶froze without being able to break them down...
 Oh! 
 That's a wonderful knob! 
~ ¶I want you to wrap your hands around the mountain of sighs, regrets and tears ¶I want you to return to that day once more.
 ¶I want you to return me to that day again ¶I want you to return me to that day again ¶I want you to return me to that day again ¶My heart is hot. ......
~ Fuyu no oh~tsubame~ ¶gaeshiiii~! 
 Nah, I can't stop crying!  ¶This doesn't make me a pussy!  ¶Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
 ¶I'm scared of my own talent. ......
 MARK03_02_02
 Yay!  I'm on top!  ¶Yay, Shami! 
 Meow! 
 Oh, my God!  ¶I can't believe I lost to my sister! 
 You're still good. ¶I'm gonna lose my dignity as a big brother ¶ if you keep this up.
Hehe~. It seems that neither Kyon-kun nor Haru-nyan were able to keep up ¶ with the flexible thinking of ¶ primary schools students.
 What a big ...... ¶You just happened to win! 
 A win is a win, even if it's just by accident~! 
 ¶Come on, man!  ¶Cheeky mouth ...... at your brother! 
 Don't get mad at me, Kyung. ¶You're pathetic.
 But you know what? ......
 It's getting late~! 
 Moo~, you're late, Mikuru-chan! 
 The head of the Compilation Lab was so persistent, ¶I couldn't quite leave the club room. ......
 What? ¶He's got some nerve courting Mikuru-chan.
 I'll beat him to a pulp in tomorrow's match, and use him as my servant for the rest of my life! 
 ¶I'm not being wooed, ¶I'm going to ...... for a mahjong match.

 All right. ¶You're the top mahjong player, ¶you're entitled to it.
 All right, then. ¶Let's sing "Ton-ne-ro-so"! 
 Wait a minute! 
 What?
 If I keep losing like this, I'm no good to you as a brother. ¶ Let's win by karaoke scores! 
 That's interesting, isn't it? ¶Following the mahjong game, I'll beat Kyung-kun in singing! 
 I'll definitely get my revenge! 
 Bone and Flesh Battle: ......
 It's getting interesting. ¶Kyung!  Sis!  ¶Sing with all your might! 
 Ooh! 
 Come on, I'm done singing.
 As expected of you, Kyung-kun, you were very good! 
 But I scored 92 points. ¶There's no way I can win! 
 Hmph. I don't know about that. ¶My song with my brother's willpower and pride on the line ...... ¶Now, what's your score! 
 Kyung-kun, I scored 80 points.
 Heh? That's all you got?
 That's a disappointing result, isn't it?
You're so pathetic. ¶ Can't you beat your sister at karaoke?
 Ugh, no way. This is impossible!  ¶To lose to my sister in a double ...... ¶Oh, my God! 
 ¶Collapse of pride......
 Poor Kyung-kun.
 Oh dear. ......
 MARK03_02_03
 Am I at the top? ¶It seems you were blessed with luck today.
 That's a very reluctant victory indeed. Mr. Niikawa.
 You've shown what's called a grown-up's composure.
 No, no, no, we just happened to win.
 ¶They're also very modest in that way.
 I agree. I aim to be a dandy like you, Mr. Shinkawa.
 You can't do it.
 Kyung-kun can't do it, can he~, Shami?
 Nya.
 With all due respect, I don't think I can either.
 Damn it!  ¶I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, and you're feverish!  ¶I'm not related to reluctance anyway! 
 It's getting late~! 
 Moo~, you're late, Mikuru-chan! 
 The head of the Compilation Lab was so persistent, ¶I couldn't leave the club room easily... ......
 What? ¶He's got some nerve courting Mikuru-chan.

 Me, the leader, of course!  ¶I'll sing "Winter Swallows Back".
 Yes, sir. ¶Then please stand by.
 Hal, hang in there~! 
 Thank you for waiting so long. ¶It's already been six months since I left you. ¶Today, I'm alone with my tears.
 ¶I want you to wrap my skin, which is as cold as falling snow.

 Hi, I'm a great MC in passing.
 Amazing!  ¶Niikawa-san, cool! 
 I'm so numb.
 Listen to my song, yeah! 
 MARK03_02_04
 Okay, I'm at the top. I'm strong after all.
 What? You're getting all worked up over a game that's just killing time. Hmph! 
 When I lose, you call me weak, a bad player, a dung beetle, and so on, but when I win, you complain about it.
 Don't you have the humility to honestly admit defeat and congratulate the winner?
 ¶You say things like, "I'm strong." ¶That's why you're bad.
 You're the one who said, 'Thanks to luck, even a no good person like me was able to win today.
 This is all thanks to Suzumiya-san. Can't you at least be humble enough to say, 'Thank you very much.
 If you did, I would at least congratulate you.
 That's not humility. It's called sneering!  ¶Who's going to say that?
 I'm late~.
 Moo~, you're late, Mikuru-chan! 
 The head of the Compilation Lab was so persistent, ¶I couldn't quite leave the clubroom... ......
 What? ¶He's got some nerve making a pass at Mikuru-chan.
 I'll beat him to a pulp in tomorrow's match, and use him as my servant for the rest of my life!

 I'm the top mahjong player, so I'll be the first to sing.
 Hey, Kyung. How about we play for karaoke scores? ¶The last one standing gets a penalty game.
 Punishment?
 ¶You'll all get decapitated. ¶I don't care if it's a blindfold.
It's too dangerous to blind them!  ¶Okay, let's make it a deco pin. ¶If you're a billy person, you're gonna get beat up by everyone else.
 Ok. Hmm, I'm on fire. ¶Come on, Kyung, sing! 
 Okay, listen up. ¶'Firing, come on'.
 Phew. I sang my heart out. ¶Now, what's the score?
 Kyung, 97 points. ¶So, soooo great! 
 All right!  Did you see that, Haruhi?
 ............
 What's the matter, can't you even make a sound?
 You're a really bad man, aren't you?
 What?
 What are you going to do when the top hitter suddenly gets a high score? Think more about the overall excitement and give a subtle score of ¶85 or so! 
 I think so too. If you suddenly get a score of 97, ¶you're almost certain to win, ¶and there's no need to listen to the song after the second person, it's as good as nothing.
 If there were any customers, ¶ there would be a riot to get your money back.
 ¶If I was a customer, I'd say, ¶If I was a customer, I'd say, ¶I'd say to the guy who suddenly gave me 97 points.
 ¶"Read the air! " ¶I was a customer. ¶I was an idiot. I'm sorry! 
 I'll get it. ¶Then we'll start the competition all over again!  ¶Now Kyung's song doesn't count! 
 I can't help it. ¶Next time, we'll go easier on him.
 And then!  ¶You can't read the air and you made everyone feel uncomfortable ¶Kyung will be punished.
 What?
 Come on, guys. ¶I'm going to impose the sanction of deco-pinning on Kyon!  ¶Give it your all! 
 Understood.
 If it's the Commander's order. ......
 Kyon-kun, I'll be gentle.
 No holds barred DEATH! 
 Now, if you'll excuse me. ......
 Ugh, stop!  I'm sorry!  ¶ Forgive me!  Helping ...... ohhhh! 
 MARK03_03_00
 ...... Well, I've booked the karaoke bar, ¶I've contacted Koizumi, so that's a relief, but ¶The problem is Nagato.
 Let's go look for her at Tsuruya Department Store.
 Whoa, there's a sign. ¶'Today's ESP Mahjong Squadron show has been cancelled due to rain'?
 Does this mean Nagato's already left? ¶¶ Is the mahjong boom even affecting the squadron show? I wonder if they're going to throw mahjong tiles at him.
 ............
 Ah, Nagato! 
 ...... Why are you here?
 I came looking for Nagato. ¶You've been here the whole time?
 ...... I'm gonna wait till it clears up. ¶When it clears up, we might put on a show. ¶We can't be too careful.
 No, you're not. ¶It's all posted up like this.
 How can you be so sure, you're not the organiser? ¶The show may be cancelled, but only the bearded mask autograph session ¶maybe we'll do it.
 Well, that's ......
 (Hey, what? ¶ Today's Nagato is hotter than ever, okay?
 ¶ Is Nagato that into ESP Squadron and the Bearded Mask? ¶ The Bearded Mask is Shinkawa-san, remember?)
 Oh, you know, Nagato. ¶Haruhi's having a karaoke contest, and she wants me to invite you. ......
 I'll wait until the department store closes. ¶I can join after that.
Until closing time? ¶ How late is this place open?
 Until 20:00.
 20:00? ¶I don't think they sing until that time, indeed.
 Then I'm not attending.
 Well, we can't have that. ¶If I don't take you with me, I don't know what kind of penalty I'll receive from Haruhi.
 (Somehow, we have to get Nagato to give up. ......)
 Hey, Nagato. ......
 MARK03_03_01
 We're calling it off for today. Let's give up. ¶ If we stick around until closing time, nothing will happen.
 No dialogue.
 I won't give up until the end.
 ¶I don't understand Nagato's passion for the squadron show, but as long as the organisers say it's cancelled, I don't think it's worth waiting.
 Instead, why don't you join us and enjoy ¶youth at karaoke?
 ............
 (No.) Nagato's heart ¶ hasn't wavered a millimetre.)
 Yeah, that's right!  ¶How about we sing a song from the ESP Squadron at karaoke?
 You've got it, right? ¶~ zeet!  A burning song like.
 O!
 (Whoa. There's a reaction. Can this work?)
 The song exists. ¶ Very hot theme tune.
 Oh, yeah. ¶Then let's go sing it.
 ¶So, don't you think that's more meaningful than waiting around in the rain?
 I agree with that. ¶But since it's an original Tsuruya department store song, ¶ it's not distributed through general karaoke.
 Eh? ¶Then you can't sing it?
 No problem. As long as you have the sound source for the theme song, you can sing it on a handy karaoke machine.
 If you want to, you can hack into the karaoke company's servers and force registration.
 No, no, no, let's not hack into their servers. ¶So, what's the sound source?
 A CD on limited sale at Tsuruya department store.
 Okay. ¶Then let's go to the CD section! 
 Okay, okay.
 (I'm glad Nagato agreed.) ¶ No, it was a nice idea on my part.)
 Thanks for coming to .......
 What? Did I say something?
 ...... CD section is on the sixth floor.
 If it's on the sixth floor, it's quicker to run down the stairs. ¶Let's go, Nagato.
 Roger that.
 MARK03_03_02
 We'll come back tomorrow. I'll come with you.
 No dialogue.
 ...... together?
 Oh. ¶If you look at this sign, ¶Tomorrow evening, it says we're going to hold a lottery to apologise for the cancellation.
 They're going to win ESP Squadron and Bearded Mask merchandise. ¶If it's a lottery, the more heads you have, the better the chances of winning ¶right?
 Lottery ...... Is that true?
 You can read about it here. ¶You didn't see the sign?
 I didn't. ¶I was determined to wait until closing, so I didn't see the ¶cancellation sign.
 ¶When you're preoccupied and narrow-minded,¶ you miss the important things. ¶That's an uncharacteristic mistake for the always calm Nagato.
 I don't have any words to return .......
 So let's pull up for the day and ¶ let's go to karaoke.
 ¶I've got a situation where if I don't take you with me, ¶I'm gonna have a disaster on my hands,
¶ I think the long gate is more fun than waiting in the rain for hours on end, don't you?
 ............
 Well, if you really want to keep waiting, ¶ I won't force you to. ......
 Are you coming to the raffle with me tomorrow?
 Oh. ¶If I win, ¶I'll give it to you.
 Okay. ¶Then I'll give up today gracefully.
 Okay!  You've made up your mind!  ¶Thank you, Nagato. ¶Then let's go to the karaoke bar! 
 Roger that. ¶Take your rain-cancelled blues to singing.
 Oh!  ¶Longgate is quietly burning! 
 MARK03_03_03
 Bearded Mask merchandise, don't you want it?
 No dialogue.
 Eh?
 ¶I don't know how Nagato feels about not giving up on the squadron show, but I can't leave you holding on to this for ¶hours on end for no reason.
 ! 
 I'll give you the Bearded Mask merchandise, ¶ so why don't we just call it a day.
 I don't think you can beat the real bearded mask, but ¶ it'll take the edge off, won't it?
 Thanks to ....... ¶But I don't want it.
 Do you still want to wait till closing?
 No, no. I'm awake. ¶It's pointless to keep waiting. ¶I don't want to cause you unnecessary worry.
 No dialogue.
 Nagato ......
 Besides, it's dangerous to keep Suzumiya Haruhi ¶waiting any longer. ¶When I came to my senses, I realised the seriousness of the situation.
 ¶Ji, the seriousness of the situation?
 You're not supposed to know. ¶The only thing I can say is, ¶you came here to save the world.
 What the hell was going on ......! 
 Hurry to the karaoke bar. ......
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. ¶I don't want you goofing off any more, ¶I don't want the world to die.
 Exactly. ¶...... bearded mask merchandise ¶give it to me some other time.
 Okay, okay. ¶Some day soon, we'll come see a squadron show together.
 Okay. Thanks. ......
 MARK03_04_00
 Now that we've made reservations at the karaoke bar, ¶now it's time to call Koizumi and Nagato.
 But neither of them answered the phone, what the hell is going on?
 Hey, Kyon-kun! 
 Ah, Tsuruya-san.
 Are you home already today? ¶What about club activities?
 Haruhi suddenly started talking about having a karaoke competition, so we're going to the karaoke bar.
 Oh, yeah, why don't you come along, Tsuruya-san? It's more exciting with more people.
 Karaoke. That sounds interesting. ¶But if you're gonna sing anyway, why don't you come to our place?
 Our house? Tsuruya-san's house?
 Yes. ¶To be precise, it's the Tsuruya family karaoke room.
 The Tsuruya family karaoke room?
 (As usual, the Tsuruya family is ¶ on a grand scale. ......)
 I'll call Haru-nyan and the others and we'll regroup.
 (What kind of place is this?) (What kind of place is this?)
 ( What kind of place is this? (What kind of place is this? ¶ The Tsuruya family's special karaoke room. ......)
 This karaoke room is amazing.
 No dialogue.
 This isn't a karaoke room. ¶It's a live music club! 
 I can't believe there's a place like this on the house grounds. ......
 Tsuruya-san's house is amazing.
I can't believe I'm going to be singing on a stage like this,¶ I'm so excited right now! 
 Thank you for waiting so long. ¶We will now present the expected new star of Tsuruya-style enka, ¶Hawk Tsuruya's one-man show! 
 It looks like something's about to start.
 Hawk Tsuruya is ...... no way! 
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tsuruya. ¶Thank you very much for coming today.
 ¶I will sing with all my heart, so ¶Please enjoy to your heart's content. ¶Now for today's first song: ......
 What a start! 
 It's not fair, Tsuruya-san!  ¶I won't let you sing alone. ¶I'm breaking in! 
 Ho-ho-ho. Haru-nyan. ¶I accept your challenge! 
 ¶Tsuruya-style enka is also known as battle enka! 
 Interesting!  ¶Take my enka spirit!  ¶Yeah! 
 It's all messed up! 
 MARK03_05_00
 ¶I came to see if there's a game store where he might be, ¶I guess I'm off the hook.
 Oh, I see you in an unusual place. ¶Have you woken up to the fun of board games, too?
 There you are. ¶You, why aren't you answering your phone?
 Sorry, sir. ¶Because I don't want anyone disturbing my blissful moment of game-viewing,
 I've put the phone on silent mode. ¶Except, of course, when the 'agency' calls.
 What bliss. ¶If I hadn't found you, ¶I'd be having a hell of a time.
 ...... and say?
 Haruhi said she was going to have a karaoke contest. ¶So, I was ordered to get you and Nagato ¶ to come and ......
 So if I hadn't been found, ¶So Suzumiya-san would have treated you badly?
 That's what I meant. ¶So, let's go to the karaoke bar.
 ...... Wait a minute.
 What is it?
 I'm not confident singing in front of you all. ¶I don't want to participate if I can help it. ......
 You know what? ¶I just explained to you what I'm up against.
 Stop whining and follow me! 
 Wait a minute. ¶Then can I have half an hour ¶ at the other shop to practice before we all meet up?
 Because I think that would give you a bit of courage.
 Would that really build up your nerve?
 Yes, sir. ¶So, please.
 All right. ¶But after 30 minutes, I'm going straight to the shop where Haruhi is! 
 Understood.
 Okay, let's practice at that karaoke bar.
 Understood. ¶But won't the people at the shop misunderstand us?
 Misunderstand? What?
 That two guys doing karaoke together ...... ¶I thought we might be having an unusual relationship ......
 Don't be boring, it's uncanny!  ¶Don't put your face any closer to mine! 
 Oh, yeah, why don't we practice a duet? ¶I'm confident I can sing with you two.
 I refuse with all my might! 
 MARK04_00_00
 Well, thank you for joining us today on our ¶ Desert Island Survival Mahjong Tour¶ with the SOS Squad.
We would like to start the first round in the evening, so ¶ until then you are free to explore the island.
 However, we are not bringing any water or food on this tour.
 In order to survive today, you will have to ¶procure¶ them with your own hands! 
 What? ¶Survival mahjong isn't a winner-takes-all game?
 Survival in the true sense of the word?
 When you heard it was Haruhi's idea, and that it was going to be held on a deserted island, you knew it was coming. ......
 So from now on, I'd like to ¶draw lots¶ to decide who will be the food procurers.
 If you win the raffle, please go and get the food without any free time! 
 When you say food, do you mean fish, nuts, ¶things like that?
 I'll leave that decision up to ¶ the person chosen to be the procurer.
 But I'd rather eat meat anyway. ¶Turuya-san, are there any animals on this island that could be used as food?
 Yeah, I guess so. ¶I'm sure there's wild boar, but I don't know the rest.
 There will be bears, but there will also be tigers. ......
 Wait a minute!  ¶Is this place really that dangerous?
 Disturbing? ¶Compared to the training centre where they practice Tsuruya-ryu kobudo, it's a cute little place.
 No, I'm not asking about that kind of comparison! 
 Shut up, Kyung. ¶...... So, let's get on with the lottery.
 No dialogue.

 There's a raffle in this box, so everyone draw one card. ¶Don't look at it right away. It opens all at once.
 Has everyone been spread out? Then open it!  ¶The person with the skull symbol is the food scavenger! 
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 Too ominous! 
 You've hit me, Nyoro! 
 I was hit too.
 Wow, I got hit too. ......
 ¶Then, you three, get on your way to get some food.
 ¶Good luck, because your work will determine whether we all live or die! 
 ¶Good luck!  I'll leave it to you! 
 (Aside from Asahina-san, ¶ I'm sure you two martial artists can handle it. ......)
 Oh yeah, if there are any ancient ruins or ¶ encounters with unknown creatures, ¶ let me know right away! 
 Tsuruya-san. ¶Are there unknown creatures here?
 ¶This is a completely isolated and uninhabited island, but ¶I'm sure there are no such things here, so don't worry.
 That's good. ¶If something like that appeared, it would be a disaster.
 Well, then, I'm off.
 Okay, everyone else, free time. ¶But while you're on this island, ¶you must stay in your swimming costumes! 
 Remember, this is the only erotic replenishment stage in the game.
 ¶Your guests will enjoy the swimming costume graphics we've prepared for you! 
 I see, that's what this desert island stage is for! 
 Kyon, talk to the girls as much as possible! 
 Ah, okay.
 Well, then, we're breaking up! 
 ¶After a while ......

 No dialogue.
But still, it's a very large group. ¶Taniguchi and Kunikida, Shinkawa-san and Mori-san, ¶and there's even the head of the Competitive Research Institute. ......
 No dialogue.
 That's right. ¶I'm the one who called them out without a second thought.
 You were the one who sent it out!  ¶But you called out, and ¶I'm surprised the head of the Competitive Research Institute came along.
 He's forced to attend. ¶as a baggage handler and scullery maid.
 Oh, come on, that's a bit much, isn't it?
 Do you know how many times we've been outnumbered by the S.O.S.? That's about as much as I can take.
 Poor thing. ......
 No mercy. ¶I'm having them set up camp now. ¶Kyung, if you're not busy, help out.
 I thought we were free to go.
 I won't force you. But if you don't help, ¶I won't let you eat anything but onions on the barbecue, so keep that in mind. Bye! 
 I don't want to just eat onions, but ¶I don't want to give in to a loose threat like that ¶I don't want to bail. ......
 ............
 Whoa, Nagato. Going somewhere?
 ...... Exploring ancient ruins.
 Ancient ruins? ¶Is there such a thing on this island?
 I'm going to go check it out.
 I'm going with you. ¶I'm sensing an ¶energy below the ground on this island that doesn't seem natural.
 I don't know if it's an ancient site or not, but ¶ it's worth checking out, so ¶ I'll go there in a bit.
 Are there any dangers?
 Most dangers are ¶ fine with Nagato-san. Right?
 ...... Leave it to me.
 So, I'll go over there for a bit.
 Ancient ruins, huh? ¶Because Haruhi mentioned something like that earlier, ¶I might just take a chance. ......
 What's wrong with Haru-nyan?
 No dialogue.
 No dialogue.
 Oops!  ¶That you'd get behind me without a care in the world!  ¶I'll do it, even though she's my sister! 
 Hey, Kyung-kun. ¶Let's explore the island together! 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ¶There could be bears and tigers on this island. ¶I'm not sure I can protect you if something like that comes out.
 It's okay. I'll take those things down! 
 No, you won't. I wasn't going to bring you to this island in the first place.
 But since you forced me to follow you, at least be quiet.
 Moo~, you're so mean, Kyon-kun!  ¶Ta-aaah! 
 Oh, wow! 
 I'll let Haru-nyan play with you, it's fine!  ¶Hmm! 
 ¶With this kick, I might be able to beat even a bear. ......
 No dialogue.
 Well, what am I going to do now?
MARK01
 I never thought in my wildest dreams that you'd hit a yakuza. You've come a long way, ......, and as your teacher, I couldn't be happier. I am your teacher, and I am very happy to be your mentor!  ,,,
 I'm not going to let you down. I'm sure you must be overjoyed to have made me so embarrassed. I'm telling you, if you think you can get away with this, you're mistaken!  I'm going to make you pay for it in the next game!  ,,,
 Are you just about to win a yaku-man and you're all excited? If I had won yakuman, I would have given you revenge, not a blessing, but since I had nothing to do with it, I'll give you a blessing. You should be thankful!  You know,, you're...
 I'm sure you must be very amused to see me, who always has a big attitude, exhausted after being sent away for a yakuza. You can laugh as much as you like. But you can only laugh now. I'm not going to go down like this!  ,,,
 Did you see that Yakuman? Did you see that yakuza? You were surprised, weren't you? I really wanted to skip you, but you survived. You're so stubborn in that way. ......,,,,
 I'd like to say that it was a dramatic ending to the game,......, but since I wasn't involved, I didn't get excited at all. The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the other person's face. I'm not a fan of the yakuza, but I've never seen them.
 I'm not sure how you can get a flush man-suppan, but it's not easy, because it's easy to lose and it's easy to get in the way, you know? I'm surprised you made it all the way to the end. Well, there's also the story that you just didn't get up because you had a bad pick, ......,,, but...
 What were you doing in the game just now? I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure you're right. I'm not saying this too strongly, but ......, you should be more determined next time!  ,,
How does it feel to be sent away by me? Are you frustrated? Or sad? If I really wanted to, it would be so easy to make you fly. I'm not going to let you go, but I'm going to make sure you're ready to fight me!  ,,,
 I'm not sure I could have seen your stunned face when you were blown away. If you're a bit shocked, just put on a poker face and keep a cool head!  If you can easily read the change of facial expression, you are at a disadvantage in a fight. You're not going to skip me, you know that?
 You're so daredevil to let me fly. I'll make up for this, so be prepared!  I'll forgive you if you transfer all your money to me in the next game, but ......,,,
 You're so good at winning by skipping. You can do it too. But, you know, don't get carried away and think you can turn on me. You know what will happen if you do that. ......? ,,,
 What's with that devilish streak? You were on such a roll, it was as if the mahjong gods had taken over. I've been playing quietly for a while now, but it won't be like this next time, you know!  You're not going to get away with this next time! 
 I'm not going to let that happen next time, you know!  I've been thinking about you a little bit. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it again!  ,,,,
 The next game was a bit better, but if you think the next game will go that well, you're wrong!  The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time I saw the film, I thought it was going to be a good one. The best way to get a good score is to get a good score. ,,,
 I'm sure I'm better than you, but how could you do this to me? I don't understand!  ,,,
It doesn't matter who comes out on top, the strong should have won the battle ......, but how did you win? I don't get it!  Rematch, rematch!  Next time I'll win!  ,,,,
 I'm not gonna let you kick me out and come out on top. Who do you think I am? I'll make you pay for this in the next game. I will not allow you to run away with the victory, you know!  ,,,,
 I thought I was going to win, but I can't believe I got upset in the end by you!  My pride is deeply hurt!  I'll admit defeat this time because I had no choice, but next time I'll turn you upside down and stand on top!  I'll turn you upside down next time and stand on top! 
 The first time I went to a golf club, I was not at all alarmed, because all I saw were cheap wins, but in the end I ended up taking the top spot. ......, I now understand that even if you don't play a big hand, if you steadily accumulate points, you can take the top spot one day. ,,,
 The best way to get to the top is by accumulating cheap hands and steadily working your way up to the top. The best way to do this is to play mahjong. I'm not going to go for a big hand with a bunch of dora, I'm going to go for a steady strategy. ......,,,,
 You're very lucky to get such a big hand so many times. I didn't know you had that kind of luck. I'm going to have to try to beat you to the high hand!  ,,,,
 I didn't lose to you in that game. I was beaten by a big hand that just happened to come to your place. You were just laying down the tiles by sheer luck!  So don't be proud of your victory. Okay!  You know, you...
 You almost jumped, but you managed to hold on just in time. The best way to do this is to get a good, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean. I was lucky, because in the end I was only last. ......,,,
 I'm not sure how you managed to keep it from flying when you were on the verge of the precipice. Are you the type that shows off your strength when you're cornered? If so, you should try not to push too hard. ......,,,,
The last round reversed the standings and knocked you down to the bottom, that was a coup de grace, wasn't it? I'm not going to hurt you, though, because it wasn't intentional. I'm going to turn the tables.
 Are you angry that I turned the tables and put you in last place? But, you know, that's the wrong person to be angry with. Mahjong is a battle of the weak and the strong, eat or be eaten, so be angry at yourself for being weak, not at me for defeating you!  ,,
 I was ahead of you, but you couldn't beat me till the end, I was one step ahead of you. I was so nervous that you might overtake me, and I lost it. ,,,,,,,the point difference wasn't that big.
 The difference in points wasn't that big, so I was playing with nervous anticipation that I might be upstaged, but somehow I managed to get away with it. The game is a lot easier mentally when you're chasing than when you're being chased. ,,,
 The ranking changes so often that I had a chance to be in the lead, but in the end I couldn't. ......, I could have won if only one big, decisive hand had come in. It's frustrating. ......,,,,
 The best way to get a good result is to play a game that you know you're going to win. I'm the head of the SOS group, but it's impossible to be weak in the game!  I have to train harder and learn to win close battles!  ,,,
 You showed me how strong you are by winning in the last minute in a comeback. I'm not going to let you down. I'm not going to let up until the end, even if I'm at the top. ,,
 Did you think you could run away with the lead like that? You're still naive. I'm here, of course it's impossible. The leading man gets to keep all the good parts in the end. That's what they promise, isn't it? ,,,
The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see a new player, you know that he's going to be a good player. The first time I went to the beach, I saw a lot of people, and I thought to myself, 'I'm not going to let that happen again'!  ,,
 The first time I saw the game, I thought it was a nightmare. ......, I can't just sit back and let him beat me one-sidedly. We'll get revenge in the next game!  ,,,,
 The game was so tight that it was unforgivable that he kept picking up the tiles he wanted and then just going away. I'm not sure I can compete with such a good technique ......, and I'm not sure I can appreciate how good you are!  I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it.
 The best way to get a good result is to use the best techniques and techniques. The most important thing to remember is that you can't go out of your way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the action. I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I'm sure you're right.
 The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're doing!  The best way to get a good result is to get a good idea of what you're looking for. The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to be a good sport!  I'm not saying ...... that wasting your luck is a bad thing!  I'm not sure what you mean by that," he said.
 I'm not sure I'd be able to do anything if you kept giving me one shot at a time like that. How can he do it so easily? You can't be psychic, can you? I'm not sure. It's ignited my fighting spirit. Watch the next game!  ,,,
 You didn't win the last game because you were too poor. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play with your friends and family, you can't just go out and play with your friends and family, you can't just go out and play with your friends and family, you can't just go out and play with your friends and family, you can't just go out and play with your friends and family, you can't just go out and play with your friends and family.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure that your money is well spent. The only way to fight tsumo is to play tsumo, but tsumo is luck, so there's no way to train it,......,,,.
The first time you play, you will be able to see the result of the game. You could have taken the lead if you hadn't swung ......, but from the middle game onwards, you should look at the field carefully and decide which tiles to discard. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of hand. ,,
 The best way to get a good score is to make a good hand, but it's meaningless if you lose money by swinging in. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play with the same hand. It's a waste of your time. I'm not saying you should go for it, but you'd better think about it a little more.
 The best way to get a good result is to use a good technique to catch the other players. Well, sometimes it's just a coincidence,......, but anyway, a lot of Ron-Ari means you have the skill and the luck, so it's tricky. I think you need to get rid of them as soon as possible. ......? I'm not sure.
 There were a lot of Ron-ari in this game. How do you keep getting the right tiles in your favour? If you have any techniques, teach them to me. I'll copy you. You can make the long hand in one shot?
 Can you make it in one shot? It's not every day you get a one-shot. You must be very lucky to get the right tile so many times. I'm confident in my luck too, but I can't beat you. ,,,
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a newborn baby, but I'm sure it's a good idea to have a newborn baby. Well, I understand how you feel. I'm not a big fan of the "I'm not a fan of the game" style, but it's no good if you just jump on the winning tile right away. It's good to have the presence of mind to deliberately miss a tile, isn't it? Of course I wouldn't do that, but ......
 Why do you target me all the time, Ron? I'm not sure what you're talking about. Don't tell me you're trying to destroy me? I don't care. I'll take that fight. I'll fight you until one of us is crushed. Now's the time to apologise!  ,,
Don't keep on calling me Ron. What do you have against me? I'm not going to be able to do that!  I tried to act like I was mad at you, ......, but it was just a coincidence. You don't have the guts to shoot at me,......,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.......
 How can you not be able to read other people's waiting positions when you have the skill of hemp mahjong to make multiple long-agaris? The best way to do this is to use the same kind of tools that you use for your own personal use. The best way is to be a little more careful. You should be a little more careful.
 You're playing rough mahjong when the number of times you've lost and the number of times you've swung in are the same. You're playing rough mahjong, when you could have easily taken the lead if you hadn't swung in. You should be more careful when choosing your discarded tiles, and look at the field more carefully. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 You've been playing a lot of games now, but you've been too defenceless, haven't you? When someone is playing a big hand, the atmosphere changes. If you can't see it, you'll never get any better. ,,,
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the difference between the two. The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when you're playing, because you're not going to be able to win. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful what you spend it on. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make the most out of your time. If you have a mangan, for example, you'll get a big hit, right? I'm not sure I'd want to do that. The first shot is bad.
 If you swing in one shot, you'll have to flip one flip and pay more points, so you definitely have to avoid it!  To avoid a one-shot riichi, reserve the fourth honor tiles and all the other cheap tiles. If you're in a bad situation, you can't help it, but ......,,.
 I'm not sure how many times you've swung at me, but thank you. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of tools that you use for your own personal use. I'm not sure what you mean by that. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'd like to see you try it out. I'm counting on you. ,,,
If it hadn't been for your strike, I would have been last. You gave me a nice assist. I'd like to give you a lot of money in return for your help in the next game, but I'm a hard worker, so don't get your hopes up. I'm not a good judge of character, so don't get your hopes up.
 The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you are doing and how you are doing it. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of hand. ,,,
 The best way to get a good result is to use the best of the best of the best, and to use the best of the best of the best. ,,,,
 The game was a great game, with one big move after another. I still can't contain my excitement. The game is a great game, but it's also exciting to play mahjong like a no-holds-barred fistfight!  ,,
 The first time I saw a game of mahjong, I was in the middle of a big game of mahjong. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful what you spend your money on. The game is a lot of fun when you make a big hand, isn't it? Now, let's keep this tenancy and start the next game!  The next game is about to begin! 
 It was an intense battle of strength against strength. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best and to use the best of the best. The first time I saw you, I thought, 'I'm not going to let you go. ,,,
 It was a tough fight right to the end. I had a chance to take the top spot,......, but I feel a greater sense of fulfilment knowing I put up a good fight, so I'm not that disappointed. I'm not a sore loser, by the way!  ,,
 I'm not that disappointed, but I'm not sorely disappointed about losing. I'm not in a position to complain, because I couldn't get up very well either. ......, I don't like wasting time, so let's make it quicker next time!  ,,
The game was all about the luck of the draw, and there was a lot of flop games. I was annoyed because you didn't make any progress. ......, Next game, I want to play well without any lapses, so go ahead and play!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be the best you can be. I sometimes aim for them too. I'd rather have a hand full of dora than the same kind of tiles, but personally I'd rather have a hand full of dora than the same kind of tiles. Aim for counted yaku-man!  ,,,
 I think it's hard to win because it's easy to lose, so everyone is on the lookout for you. ......, but I personally don't dislike your stubbornness in sticking to your dyed hands. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see a woman in the same room as you.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be the best you can be. I'm not a big fan of the toi-toys, but I do like toi-toys, too. The toi-toy is a complicated game.
 I like the simplicity of Toy Toy Toys, where you don't have to think about complicated roles to play. I love the fact that you can dream up a lot of different ways to play, such as Toy Idora 3, or Dora 4 after a Kan!  I love Dora, so this is the best role for me. I like to play with a hand, even if it's a cheap hand.
 The best way to get to the top is to make a series of chan with the first hand, even if it's a cheap hand, and slowly build up your points. The best way to win is to get a cheap hand, and if you keep the points in mind, you can win with just a cheap hand. The best way to win is to play with a single cheap win. The best way to get a good deal is to get a good deal on a cheap hand.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make the most out of your time. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful. ,,,,
 You played so many games early. The game was too fast for you to win at all!  The game is not just about going fast in mahjong!  You're too fast for me!  I'm not sure I like it. ,,,
Hey!  If you attack that fast, I don't stand a chance. How can you go so fast? I'm not going to let you win, but you can't afford to be complacent. I'm going to detonate the Dora bomb and you're going to be blown away!  ,,
 MARK02
 I'm not going to let you down. I'm not going to let you go. The face you made when you won is one you won't forget for a while. The first time I saw him, I thought he was a good shot. Congratulations!  I never thought I'd win a yakuza.
 The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you're doing. The moment I swung it, I was blinded by darkness. The first time I played, I was in the middle of the game, and I was in the middle of the game. I'll pay you back for this in the next game, so be prepared!  I'll pay you back in the next game, so brace yourself! 
 I was honestly surprised that you could win a yakuza. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure that it is not a car that will be used for a long time!  ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and get a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a bad deal. I'm shocked ......, but I can't stay depressed forever. The next game will be a revenge game. I'm going to win this time, so watch me!  ,,,
 I'm still in a state of excitement. I'm still in a state of excitement. I'm still in a state of excitement when I remember the moment I won. I'm still in a state of excitement when I remember the moment I got up there!  The first hand was a yakuza, but the second hand was a yakuza.
 The first time I went to a golf club, I was surprised that it was settled with a yaku-man. I'm not sure I've ever seen a more dramatic ending. The next time we're in the lead, we'll do our best!  ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to be a good player to get a good score. The best thing is that you can get a good deal on the game. The best thing is that you can do it. ,,,,
What's wrong with you that you can't win even once? Either the tiles were badly dealt or the Tsumo was no good ......, in any case, you've got to be on top of things. The next time you play, good luck!  ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do it. The first time you see a man, you'll know that he's a man. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of tools that you use for your own personal use. I don't know how you feel, but I know you fought as hard as you could.
 I'm sure it must be very frustrating to be skipped over and defeated. I can't help but feel the same way. But if you play mahjong, you can get skipped over at least once in a while. If you get skipped over, you can always try to get revenge by skipping over the other way. Don't lose next time!  You can't fly me.
 I can't believe you let me fly. The first time I saw him, I thought he was a friend, but he's a shocker ......, and it's even more ungrateful to try to interfere in a serious match. I'm not going to let you get away with this!  ,,,
 I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure you're right. I'm not going to let you be the only one who looks good. Next time, I'll fly someone else and make a smug face. Hey,, hey, hey, hey.
 I'm not gonna let you get away with that. I'll admit defeat this time. I'll admit defeat this time, but you must have used up all your luck with that streak. I'll win the next game. I'm going to win the next game.
 You won by a landslide. Congratulations. I can't catch up with you when you're ahead by that many points. I know it sounds pathetic, but I gave up on the game about halfway through. I've given up on the game, but only this time. I'll beat you next time. I'm going to beat you next time.
 I'm going to beat you next time. I'm not going to let you down this time. Is this your ability? Is this your ability, or are you just a stupid wig? I'm not going to back down from this, either way. I'll take revenge in the next game!  I'll take my revenge in the next game! 
I'm not sure I'd be able to do it if I lost in a fight like that. I'm not sure I've ever seen you do that before. No, no, no, that's not true. This time, you just happened to have the luck. I'll win this time!  I'm gonna win this time! 
 I had my chance to win, but in the end you beat me. ......, maybe I haven't trained enough. All right, for the sake of my training, please come with me one more time for a game!  Please!  Please! 
 I've been in a lot of trouble. I'm not going to let this end in frustration. I'm going to be the next one to drop you into hell, so be enlightened!  ,,,,
 I thought I could get away with it, but I never thought I'd get the tables turned in the end. I'm not sure I'm going to win like this, but I'm going to win. I'm not going to let you win and run away like this, are you? Give me a chance for revenge!  ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be honest with yourself. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be a good player.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get a good result is to use body blows rather than aiming for a big KO. The best way to do this is to be confident in your own technique. I'm not a fan of the way he fights, but it's fun and I learn a lot from him. Can you do it again? ,,,
 I'm not sure how many times I'm going to have to play that move. The best way to do that is to make a few more moves like that. If you say it's not luck but skill, then you should be able to win the next game as well. Show me your ability one more time!  You've got to show me that again! 
 I'm not sure I can win if you make such a big move. I'm sorry, but you won this time. I'll surprise you with a big move in the next game, so be prepared. ,,,
You almost flew. The fact that you stayed in the air is proof that you haven't given up on your luck. But the fact that you stayed on your feet and didn't fly is proof that luck hasn't given up on you, so you'll get another chance sooner or later. Don't be discouraged. ,,,
 The first time I saw the film, I thought it was a bit of a joke, but it was a good one. You're not going to be able to get away with it. The first time you go out, you're going to be in the same position as the rest of the field. ,,,
 The best way to get a good result is to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result, and to get a good result. The first time I went to the beach, I was in the middle of the ocean, and I was in the middle of the ocean, and I was in the middle of the ocean. You know, I...
 I didn't want to lose, so I got the upset win in the end. I'm not going to let you get away with it. If you are, then take that anger and put it into the next match. The next game will be more exciting. ,,,
 You almost beat me, but it was too close. I'm not sure if I'm right or wrong, but I'm not sure if I'm right. If you are frustrated, you can try to beat me in the next game. I'm always up for a challenge!  I'm ready to accept your challenge! 
 The game was so close to the end that it could have gone the other way at any time. The first time I saw you, I thought I'd seen you. The first time I saw the game, I thought I'd seen a lot more of it," he said. ,.
 The game was a battle where you didn't know who was going to win until the very end. The first time I played, I was in the middle of the game, and I was in the middle of the game, and I was in the middle of the game, and I was in the middle of the game!  I'll beat you next time! 
 The first time I played, I was in a position to take the lead, but in the end, I couldn't win. If I had played a little better, I could have won. ......, well, it doesn't matter if you complain. I'll do my best next time!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,and
I can't believe they finally pulled him down from the top. I'm sure he's in shock. I'm sorry I'm too strong!  I can't forgive myself for being so strong. I'll be happy to accept a revenge match, so come at me anytime!  I'm sorry, man.
 I'm sorry, but I had to go backwards and take the top. I couldn't lose like that. I wanted to win too. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm not asking for forgiveness, I'm asking you to take your anger out on the next fight. I'll take it in a fair fight!  I'll take it, fair and square! 
 I'll take it!  I'll take it!  I'll take it, fair and square!  I'll just have to accept defeat this time. The only thing that matters is the quality of the music. I'm not going to let you down. Don't lose heart.
 I'm not going to let you down. I'm not a fan of that stupid wig. I'm not sure what to do with the money, but I'm sure it's a good idea. I'm not going to let you do that to me!  I'm not going to let you down.
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I think it's a good idea. It's advantageous to have a good draw, isn't it? The best way to get a good result is to get a good result. The most important thing is that you have to be able to get the best out of your own hands!  ,,,
 The game was going really well, wasn't it? Tsumo!  I hated the look on your face when you said "Tsumo!  Well, if you're that good at it, you'll be good at it. ......, Next time I'm going to decide to play Tsumo with my best face!  ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be a good player. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of equipment that you use for your own personal use. But you shouldn't get too carried away. But you shouldn't get too carried away, because such great luck won't last. ,,
How strong are your pulls today? You've been hit so many times, you can't do anything about it. I'm not going to let you get away with this. I'm going to start hating mahjong if this keeps up. ......,,,,, I didn't even swing at it.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be a good player. The most important thing to remember is that you can't afford to lose your money. ......, but it's not like you're losing by swinging, so you'll get your chance someday. The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when you are playing!  ,.
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when you're playing, and you can't be too careful when you're playing. The only way to stop a guy who has a good Tsumo is to shift the order of the Tsumo by ringing him,......? I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play with the same hand. The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to be a good player to win. I'm not going to tell you what to do now, ......,, but I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
 I've been making a lot of transfers, but have you let your guard down? The most important thing is that you have to be careful. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play with the same old, same old, same old. ,,
 The best way to get the best out of the game is to use the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players and the best players. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm going to do it!  I want to steal your technique, so can we play one more time? ,,
 The best thing is that you can't make me throw away a winning tile at will, can you? You're so hypnotised, you've decided to win the pot so many times, you'd think so. I'm not falling for your tricks anymore. I'll win the next game!  ,,
You're as sharp as a sniper, taking the long shot on target. I'm not sure I'd be able to do it if I was in the same situation as you!  I'm not sure if I'm going to be traumatised by that. It's traumatising, ......,,,.
 The best way to do this is to use the tiles that you can't predict the wait for, to mislead us, and make us swing at the right tiles at once.......you're quite the trickster to pull off such a sophisticated thing. I'll have to be very wary of your reach, ......,,,.
 I'm not sure if you were shooting at me in the game just now. The first time you do this, you'll be in a position to make a decision. The next time, I'll put up a good defence so that you won't swing at me again. ,,
 The first thing to do is to make sure that you have the right tools and the right people to help you. The next time you are in the market for a new pair of shoes or boots, you should consider the price of the new pair of shoes. I'm not going to be your next, you know. ,,,
 The next time you're in the game, you're not going to get what you want. If you didn't swing, you'd be winning. ......, You should look at the scene more, choose a safe tile and cut it. The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to take a chance on a new player. You've made the long hand so many times.
 You're losing a lot of money because you're swinging too many times, even though you're winning many times. You should examine your discarded tiles more carefully. Careless discarding of tiles will shorten your life. ......, but it won't affect your life, will it? The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing, you'll be surprised.
 It may be none of your business, but let me say something. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your life is to be careful. I think you're swinging in too far at any rate. ,,
 You've swung too many times in the last game. You're not in shock, are you? The game was a bit of a shock, wasn't it? ,,,
The most important thing to remember is that the best way to avoid this is to avoid the first shot. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to avoid the first shot is to cut the actual tiles as much as possible right after the reach. If you don't have any tiles, you can't help it, but you have to avoid ...... just one shot. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of a game is to play it.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of the game is to be a good player. The first time you play, you'll get a lot of money. The first thing you should do is to be a little more careful right after you reach ......, don't make me say something too obvious. I'm not a fan of the "I'm not a fan of the game" approach.
 I'm not sure how many times you've helped me win, thank you very much. I'm really grateful for the nice assist. I'll be waiting for you in the next game, too. I'll be waiting for you!  ,,,,
 I didn't think you could swing at me so many times. I'm sorry I got so many points like that. I'm sorry I got such a good score, but you're a good friend who helps me win. I'll be counting on you from now on!  ,,,
 The best way to get a win is to play with a tile that is not in your hand, but is not in your hand. The best way to do it is to play without ringing as much as possible. The best way to play is to play without flipping.
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you play, you'll be able to see the difference in the way you play. The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you want to do, and then you can do it. I'm not sure I'd like that.
 The first time I went to the beach, I saw a lot of people and I was very nervous about it. The next game should be a quieter one. ......,,, If you get a big hand, you can't play with a big hand, so you have to be careful not to swing.
 If you get hit with a big move, you get back at them with a big move. The first time I played, I was in the middle of a game. The next game is also expected to be somewhat rough. I don't really welcome ......,,,.
If you get a point, you get it back!  The game was a fierce battle, with no one knowing who would be the last to win. The best way to get a good idea of what to expect from the game is to go to a mahjong shop and buy a few tickets. The best way to get the most out of the game is to play it.
 The first time I went to a game of Mahjong, I was really impressed by the way the four of them fought with all their might. The best way to get the most out of your money is to buy a new car or truck. I like to play with brains and wits, rather than this kind of forceful mahjong. ......,,,,
 The game was very time-consuming, with a lot of redundancies. The best way to get the most out of your money is to use it. The next time you play, attack aggressively and end the game quickly and without any lapses. ......,,,,,The next game, attack aggressively and end the game quickly and without any lapses!  I'm not sure how to do it, but I'm sure I can do it.
 The next game will be more aggressive, and we'll try to finish it without any loss. The game is just a long, useless game, and it's very boring. The game is very boring to play!  The game is not a game of chance.
 I understand the feeling of wanting to aim for Hongitsu or Chinitsu. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of equipment as you would use in a normal game. In fact, it's hard to go up because it's so obvious, but ......, how is it that you still can't stop yourself from wanting to dye your hands? The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do it.
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do it. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure it's not a car that's going to be used for a long time. The most important thing is that the people who are in charge of the project are the people who are in charge of the project. The most common reason for this is that the people who are trying to get to the top are the ones who have the most experience.
 The most popular target is the toy, but do you really like it that much? The most important thing is that you can't be too careful with the handmade cards, and if you have a dora, it has great destructive power, so many people like it. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your mahjong game is to play with a good hand. The best way to do that is to use a handmade mahjong hand. The game is a matter of taste, but...
The image of Toy Toy is that it's easy to go up because you can pick up from anyone and it's hard to know which tiles will win, but there is a disadvantage that it's hard to turn and play because there are only a limited number of tiles in your hand. The best way to do this is to think about switching to other hands, rather than just playing toe-to-toe. The first hand is the most popular.
 The best way to get a good score is to make a cheap hand, but don't you think it's a waste to give up the pleasure of developing a big hand? The best way to do that is to play a cheap hand and rack up scores, which is part of the strategy, but don't you think it's a shame to give up the pleasure of growing big hands? ,,,
 The best way to get a good hand is to play a cheap hand, but no matter how many times you play a cheap hand, it's meaningless if you get turned around with just one big hand, isn't it? I'm not sure how many times I've been up against a cheap hand, only to have it reversed with a single big hand. You're right, you're right.
 The best way to do this is to use the same techniques and techniques. The best way to get a good result is to use the best techniques and techniques. The next game will be a good game. I won't let you win the next game. ,,,
 Oh, no!  How did he get there so fast? You got some kind of accelerator or something? If that speed is not luck, but real technique, I'll call you master. Well, I think it's just luck, though. ......,,
 MARK03
 The first time you see a new player, you know he's going to be a good player. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful when you are making your investment decisions. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be prepared for the unexpected. The most important thing to remember is that the more you know about the game, the more you will be able to make the most out of it. The first time I saw the film, I was impressed by the fact that it was so well done. ,,,,
 I was impressed by your skill in finishing the yakuza. I was not directly affected, so I congratulate you. Congratulations, I'm sure you'll be very happy with the results. ,,,,,,
 The first time I saw the game, I thought it was going to be a big game, but it wasn't. I was surprised. I had thought that the probability of getting blown away by a yaku maku was almost zero,......, but this time I am indeed very upset. Mahjong is terrible. ,,,,,
You have won a yaku-man. An extremely low-probability hand was played exactly as desired. It was truly a triumph. I am delighted now. I like mahjong more and more. ,,,,,
 The best way to get a good result is to play the game with a good hand. The first time I went to a game of mahjong, I was surprised to find out that the game had ended in yaku-man, which was a surprise. I will be very careful not to play Yaku-Man in the future. ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get a good result is to be careful not to swing at the Yaku-Man. I was shown a rare thing. I thank you. ,,,,,,,
 The fact that I could not get up at least once during the game was either bad luck, lack of effort or lack of skill. ......, You should analyse the situation properly and try to get up at least once in the future. ,,,
 The most important thing is that you should be able to see the difference between the two. However, this is the result of our mutual efforts to fight, so it is wrong to hold a grudge. Winning and losing are always ruthless,......,,,.
 I think it's very painful to be blown away and defeated. However, this defeat is not the end of everything. Instead of being disappointed and depressed, you should turn your attention to the next battle. ,,,,,
 I never thought I would experience the humiliation of being skipped over and defeated. I was never proud of it,......, but I have to reflect on it and make sure I don't make the same mistake again,......,,,,
 The deciding blow was very, very brilliant. The first time I played, I was in the middle of a game, and I was in the middle of a game, but if the timing had been wrong, I might have been sent flying, and that gives me a delicate feeling. Mahjong is a deep, deep game. ......,,,,
 The first time I saw the game, I realised firsthand how destructive the accumulation of consecutive chans can be. But such good luck doesn't last that long. You must not let your guard down or be too proud. Be careful in your next game. ......,,,,
 It is commendable that you won the top position with such a high score. Congratulations. But at the same time, you stepped on the tail of the tiger that is me. Next time, I won't lose. ......,,,,,
Whether by merit or a lopsided stroke of luck, your victory is still the same. This time, I accept defeat gracefully. But we will not allow you to escape with the victory. I demand a rematch. ,,,,
 The strength of the game to win a battle in which the standings change rapidly is ......,very impressive. The best way to do this is to be a good player, but it could also be just good luck. If you want to prove that you are a force to be reckoned with, you should fight me again. ,,,
 Winning a tussle is proof of your strength. And your victory over me is commendable. But I've already analysed your style of play. The next time we have a close match, I'll be on top. ,,,
 I am shocked at the outcome, as I was confident of victory. I was not aware of it, but maybe I was too proud. I thank you for making me realise that. Thank you. ,,,,
 The last time I played, the game was reversed. The first time I went to the game, I was so embarrassed because I felt like I had been caught off guard when I thought I had escaped at the end of the last round. I'm going to reflect hard so that I don't make such a blunder again. ......,,,,
 The first time you play, you may win one game at a time, but if you keep on accumulating, you will be at the top of the game. I was reminded of the basics of the basics. The next time I play, I'll chew on these words and fight on. ,,,,
 The first thing to do is not to aim for a big move, but to win by making a series of cheap moves. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing is when you see the same thing in the same place. The first time I saw the game, I was surprised to find that the game was so close to the final. I am grateful for that. The,,,
 The first time I saw the game, I was in the middle of a fight, and I was in the middle of a fight. I want the guts and luck to finish off such a big move. ......,,,,,
 The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good time. I lost the will to fight in the middle of the game. I'll fight with a strong heart that won't break in the middle next time. ,,,,
I admire your guts for staying on at the last minute when you were in danger of being sent flying. If you have that guts, you can make up for this loss in no time. Good luck ......,,,,,
 You were in a critical situation where you could have been sent away at any time, but you survived to the end. I would like to pay tribute to your stubbornness. I wish I could use that stubbornness in my life, too. ......,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be honest with yourself. I know how frustrating it is, but this is a game too. I'm not going to hate me for the result. ,,,,
 I won the upset because I stuck to the game until the end. I think you were caught off guard, you had an opening. I want you to analyse the cause of your current defeat and use it in your next fight. ,,,,
 If you think that you could have upset me in a few seconds, but it was a close result,......, then you are naive. The best way to do this is to make sure that you have a good time. To beat me, you need to work harder......,,,,
 The first time I saw him, I was scared that he would turn the tables on me, but in the end I won. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was just trying to lightly provoke you. ,,,
 I'm not going to let my inability to win the current race make me feel sorry for my inability to win. I don't want to leave it to luck, but it's frustrating to think that with a bit more luck we might have won. ......,,,,
 It was a battle whose outcome was not clear until the very end. I am very disappointed that everyone, including myself, had a chance to come out on top, but it ended in a disappointing way. The only thing that saved us was that the match was good. ......,,,,
 In the end, we turned the tables and I came out on top. You were so traumatised by the upset that you can never beat me again. ......,If you think it's a lie, try it again? ,,,,
You have defeated me. It was a humiliating way to lose, being upstaged at the end of the game. ......, I know it must be frustrating, but that's the reality. Think about why you lost, analyse it, and make it useful for your future mahjong training. ......,,,
 The game was exactly like that. I was in a situation where I was running alone, and they wouldn't let me do anything. I'm not sure how long I can keep it up. I'm sure my turn will come next. I want to believe that. ,,,
 The fight was terrible. The luck that should have been equal was concentrated in the hands of the players. The result is a disappointing ......,Uneven luck is also one of the most interesting aspects of mahjong. It is very interesting......,,,,
 The fact that there are so many Tsumo Agari is proof that you are riding a wave of good luck. The most important thing to remember is that you have to be careful not to let your luck get away from you. If you think you've got it all figured out,......, you're mistaken. It is normal for good luck not to last. Don't be too careless. ,,,
 Why are you the only one who can get so many good Tsumo, so many times? I felt it was very unfair during the game. I'm not sure if it's a good thing, but it's a good thing that I've been lucky enough to play mahjong with a big smile on my face like you...
 The first time I played mahjong, I was surprised at how many times I got one-shot tsumo, and I was disappointed at the emptiness of having my score taken away from me without any resistance. The first time I played, I was very surprised and disappointed to be robbed of my score without any resistance. I hope you will go easy on me next time, if possible. ,,,
 The probability of you making that many one-shot Tsumo is so low that it's impossible. The best way to get the most out of the game is to use the best of the best. ......, Is your good luck a monster? The best way to get a good deal is to get a good deal on a good deal on a good deal of things.
 No matter how hard you try to avoid the swing, if you get a Tsumo, you lose a point. The most important thing is that you have to be able to play the game. The best way to get a good score is to avoid the swinging in. The best way to do this is to believe that, and try to play solid mahjong. The best way is to play mahjong.
Even if you play defensive mahjong, which can be called iron-clad, you are powerless in front of Tsumo Agari. The only thing to do is to curse the luck of the winner. The best way to get the most out of the game is to play a game of mahjong. In the end, the one with the strongest defence will win. ......,,,
 The best way to win is to keep your eyes on the field, and look at the field carefully. The best way to get to the top is to practice looking at the field carefully and detecting the danger tiles. Discard tiles carefully ......,,,,
 Tsumo is a matter of luck, but you can decide on your own which tiles to discard. It's a shame to have the luck to get a Tsumo Go Out but lose it by carelessly discarding a tile. If you learn to play defensive mahjong, you will become much stronger. ......,,,,
 The first time I saw the game, I thought I was going to win, but I didn't. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. The best way to do this is to learn from the best. I would like to learn from him. ,,,,,
 The best way to learn is to learn how to play the game and to learn how to play the game. I want you to teach me that magic too,......,,,,
 It is not easy to make a one-shot Ron. It is necessary to accurately assess the flow of the scene and the timing. The skill to do it over and over again is very impressive. I am honoured to have fought against such a good opponent as you. ,,,
 The way you hit the target with a single blow. You were as accurate as a sniper taking out his prey with a single blow. I'm not going to be able to run away if you're aiming at me. ......,,,,,
 Why have I swung at you so many times? The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful. If so, I'll be more careful next time. ......,,,
 I can't believe I made the unthinkable mistake of repeatedly cutting your Ron Tile. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, it's about the player. ......This analogy is also somewhat strange. I'm in a bad mood today. ......,,,
In the current game, the number of Ron-agari and Furikomi was almost the same. If the number of points is that high, it is very difficult to get to the top. I strongly recommend that you make an effort to reduce the number of transfers. The number of times you have to make a long long hand is very high.
 The best way to get to the top is to make an effort to reduce the number of times you make the long turn. The best way to get a good score is to give up on the game. It is less risky to get out than to transfer ......,,,.
 The game is not a game of chance. The best way to do this is to use the same method as the one used in the previous game. It is not advisable to cut carelessly. You have to pay more attention, otherwise you won't be able to win in a tough fight. Be careful. ,,,,
 There are many reasons why there are so many swings, but you should avoid cutting tiles without warning. You should look carefully at the scene and choose your discarded tiles carefully. Sometimes it is necessary to get off. ,,,,
 The extra flip, one-shot swings, are too risky and risky. The theory is to cut a safe tile such as a cash tile immediately after riichi, unless you have a very competitive hand. That is the only rule that should be observed. ,,,,
 Why do you repeatedly make one-shot poker? The player who is not afraid to take risks has a strong heart, but if the scene is disturbed because of the one-shot swing, the other players will also be inconvenienced. The first round is better to choose a safe tile, at least. ,,,
 I am grateful for the many times you have swung at me. Thanks to you, I had a good time. I am grateful for that. I'd like to thank you for your kindness, but that doesn't mean I'm going to transfer the tile to you in the next game, so please keep it that way. ,,,
 I thank you from the bottom of my heart for cutting my winning tile so many times. Thank you. The best way to get a good result is to use the best possible method. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not the only one. ,,,
The tendency to play a lot of Naru is worrying. The most important thing to remember is that the player has to be able to play the game without ringing. The best way to do that is to fight without ringing. I don't force you to do it, but ......,,,, I don't say it's wrong to play.
 The best way to get a good result is to play with a good handmade mahjong hand. If your priority is to get a good result rather than making a handmade one, I won't interfere. ......,,,,
 Why did the big hands go on such a spree? (Thingo didn't even bother trying with this bit) The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure that you have the best possible deal. ......,,,,
 The first thing that comes to mind is a stormy development, with big, destructive hands clashing. The game was aptly described as a gripping ...... match. The game was a great success, and I hope to have the skills to ensure victory in this kind of rough battle. ,,,
 The game was a dead heat, with one upset after another ....... The best way to get the best out of your game is to play a little bit of Mahjong. The next game will be very exciting as well. ,,,,
 The four players are seriously clashing in a gachinko match ...... and are feeling pleasantly tired after a battle in which they couldn't let up for even a moment. The first time I saw a man in a bikini, I thought, 'I've never seen such a thing before. ,,,,
 The number of games lost this time around was high. The next game will be more difficult. I would like to play the next game with a better tempo. If possible, I would like you to transfer the game to me. ......,,,,
 The game was a game in which all four players had no decisive moves, and the game was a series of null games. The next game, I would like to play with the highest priority on going up quickly, even if it's a slightly cheap move. The next game is a bit cheaper, but I want to give top priority to going up as soon as possible.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of the game is to play the best game you can. The most important thing is that you should not be afraid of the tiles you are going to throw away if you go for a dyed hand, but still stick to a dyed hand. ...... is very interesting. ,,,
If you dye your hand, you will be immediately exposed by the discarded tiles and the way you ring. The game is very easy to understand and easy to counter, so it is difficult to finish it. The fact that you insist on dyed hands in spite of ......, ......, is foolish and foolish, but you are single-minded and wonderful ......,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be a good player. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go to the store and buy a new one, you have to make it your own. I would enjoy more variety and handmade ......,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful what you spend your money on. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, it's about the player. The best way to do this is to use a cheap hand and make sure you get a good score.
 The best way to do this is to make a cheap hand and secure a point or two. There is no mistake in that strategy. However, if you play only cheap hands, you run the risk of being reversed by a single blow from a big hand. If possible, you should also aim for big moves. ,,,,
 I understand the idea of getting away with a quick and cheap win. But the cheapest way to get away is with a pistol. It is powerless in front of a big hand like a cannon. It would be better to put a bigger hand in the field of vision and strike with it. The speed of finishing the move, the
 The speed with which the hand was completed was astonishing. Either he read the flow of the tiles perfectly, or it was just luck. ......, Either way, I lost this time. It's frustrating, but ......,,,,
 The game was played very fast. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the game is so fast, I can't keep up with it. In other words, I can't win. I hope that the speed this time is just luck. ......,,,,

It's hard enough just to transfer the money, but it's even harder if you transfer it in one shot. You'll be in a panic. Don't swing in at the first shot!  Immediately after riichi, cut a safe tile!  ,,,,
 You have a lot of guts to cut a dangerous tile without fearing a one-shot swing in. But if you get swung in, it's just a reckless act. ......, Shouldn't you be careful only after riichi? ,,,
 I'm not sure how many times you've transferred me, thank you. I've scored a lot of points thanks to you. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it again in the next game,......, but I'm being too lenient. I'm sorry. ,,,,

 You played a lot of ringing in the game just now, didn't you? I'm not sure if it's because you can get out of the game faster if you ring. I'd like to try a flexible method of making moves with pon and chi, without sticking to menzen: ...... ,,,
 The more tiles you have in your hand, the more you are at a disadvantage if you are going to be riichi. (The computer disappoints) The first is the one that is the most popular. The first time I saw the game, I thought, 'I'm not going to play this game'.
 The game was a great game, with lots of high moves. I was playing with a lot of excitement the whole time. I was more interested in the game than usual because I was so excited. ,,,,,

If you get a point, you can immediately take it back. ...... It was a close game where you couldn't see what was going to happen next, so it was mentally very tiring.

 The game was a lot of nullification, wasn't it? The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the game, it's about the game. I don't like to be lazy and play a lot of games!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 It's fun to make a hand by collecting tiles of the same type, like Chintu or Honitsu. You can also use the same tiles in the same way as in the case of Chintu or Honitsu. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I think it's a good idea.
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing is when you are looking for a new place to live. Even I know that much. I don't know why I want to aim at dyed hands, even though it's so obvious. Why is that? The same tiles are used in the same way in the same hand, but with the same tiles in the same hand.
 Toys are easy to make, because you only have to collect the same tiles. You can also use other people's discarded tiles. If you play too many tiles and you end up with a single naked player, it's a lot of work. ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, but about the player. The word "pon" has an interesting ring to it. The first time I went to the beach, I was in the middle of the night!  The same is true for the other two. The best way to do this is to use a computer. I've been playing the cheapest hands.
 I'm sure you've been playing cheap hands, but don't you aim for high hands? I'm not sure if it's right to aim for easy hands like you do, since high hands are hard to win. ......,,,,
No matter how big a hand you play, if you don't win, you won't gain a single point. Then it is better to increase the number of points, even if it is 1,000 points. Watching your way of playing, I have reaffirmed the importance of going up. I also have to try to play faster. I want to be quick, too.
 The best way to get away with it is to get up quickly. ...... If you get into the pattern, your way of playing may be the strongest. I'm going to try to play with more speed too,......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be able to read the flow of the game and cut. I'm not sure how to do it, but I'm sure you can do it. I was surprised at the speed, either way. I can't imitate it. I'm envious of you. ......,,,
 MARK05
 I am very happy to hear that you have won. I'm very happy, aren't you? The first time I played, I was in the middle of a game, and I was in the middle of a match. The other players have suffered a great deal, but ......,,,, don't let your Yaku-Man get in the way.
 The first time I saw the game, I thought, 'I'm not going to be able to win this game. The most important thing is that you have to be able to get the best out of the game. I'm not sure if I'd like to thank you for the rare experience of ......,,,,.
 Congratulations on your yakuman. You're very good at finishing yaku-man, aren't you? I'm sure you'll be able to do it. I'd like you to share some of that luck with me, too. I'm aware of my weakness in the game, you know.
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to play with a lot of people. I'm glad you had this rare experience, but I wish I could have won yakuman by myself ....... ,,,
 I am sure you must be surprised that I won Yakuman. I myself still can't believe it. I'm in a bit of a buoyant mood at the moment. I'm embarrassed to say this, but ......,,,,
The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see a person in the same room with you is when you see them. The first time I went to a mah-jongg game, I never thought I'd experience such alienation,......,,,,.
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the game. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the whole picture. I've never been able to get up there.
 The result was disappointing, not even once. The most important thing to remember is that you are not alone in your lack of ability, so don't be discouraged. ,,
 I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm going to do it. I don't think so, I didn't expect to fly away ......, don't be grumpy because I flew away, don't be grumpy because I flew away. I also win sometimes,......,,,,.
 It's hard to be skipped and lose, isn't it? I know exactly how you feel, as I always lose. I'm sure you'll win your next game. I know my words are not convincing, but ......,,
 I was skipped over in spectacular fashion. The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you are doing and how to do it.
 The best way to win is to skip someone else and settle it. The best way to win is to win by skipping someone else. ,,,,,
 No one could stop your momentum. The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who has the ability to do this. If I had just a little bit of that luck, I could get rid of the stigma of being the guy who loses at everything. ......,,
It was an overwhelming strength that stood out from the rest. The momentum was different from the other members, including me. I'm sure it feels good to win by yourself. I'm envious. ,,,,
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time I saw a game, I thought it was a good idea to have a game. The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do it. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'd like to see it.
 The best way to get a good start is to get a good idea of what you're looking for. The best way to get the best out of your game is to play the game you want to play, and to play the game you want to play. I'm impressed. ,,
 I had a chance to win the top position in this game, but in the end I lost to you. I thought I had reached a good point, but I'm sorry. I thought I had a good chance to get to the top, but in the end I lost to you. ,,,
 I was expecting to win this time, and then you turned the tables at the end and took the top, you are a bad person. I'm sure I should lament my lack of success before complaining to you, but ......,,,, don't let them turn the tables on you at the last minute,,,, you know.
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and get the ball. ,(Untranslated, but why not?) I'm a bit frustrated this time around. ......,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not only a big winner with big moves, but you have also learnt how to fight steadily. ...... The first thing that comes to my mind is the fact that you are a good person. The first time I saw him, I thought, 'I'm not going to let him get away with that'. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure you get the most out of your time. The game is a very good one. The first time I played, I was surprised to find that I was the only one who could win. I think I've seen an unexpected side of you. ,,,
The best way to win is to make sure you make the big moves at the few chances you get, and then defend and keep your top position. ...... It's a clever way to win, without making any unnecessary moves. If you can decide on that winning pattern, you may never lose to anyone. ......,,,
 You won the fight by simply landing a powerful punch. The result is a result that can only be achieved by a combination of luck and skill. It was a really brilliant victory. This time ......, I take my hat off to you again. ,,,
 The last time I was in the same position, I was in the bottom of the table, but I was in the top of the table. The same, the same last place, but the damage would have been different if you had been blown away, so you might have been lucky. The best thing is that you can be lucky. The first time I saw him, he was in the middle of a fight.
 The first time I saw the game, I was in a pinch to be sent flying, but I stayed on till the end, didn't I? The best way to do it is to be a good player. I want to learn from you too. ,,,,
 I am very sorry that I put you in last place because I went up at the end. I was more surprised than happy to have won, I think. Well, I was surprised. ......,,,
 I would normally have lost, but this time, I won in reverse. I'm not sure what to expect. I hope you won't hold a grudge against me, ......,,, because this is part of the game.
 I hope you don't hold it against me, but it's a bit of a happening, me coming out on top over you. I'm not sure if it's a good thing, but it's a good thing. I'd be happy if I could keep up this good form and win the next game too. ......,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your game is to be a good player. The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when it comes to your own personal information. The most important thing is that you have to be careful. I'm not a good person to be too careless.
You and I, of course, had a chance to take the top spot, but it ended in a disappointing way, didn't it? I'm not sure if we can win in such a crowded field, then maybe we're still not mature enough yet. Let's get back into the swing of things, shall we? ......,,
 The game had a lot of fluctuation in the rankings. I also had a chance to take the lead, but I ran out of energy and gave up in the middle of the game. I think you have to have a strong will and not give up until the end to win the game. Not only in mahjong, ......,, but also in any other game.
 I think you are disappointed that you lost the top spot to me at the last minute, aren't you? I didn't want to be a part of it, but I couldn't pass up the victory that was right in front of me, so I let him win. I didn't want to get involved, but I couldn't pass up the victory that was right in front of me, so I let him win. ,,
 I'm not sure if it was a mistake to let me slip up at the last minute, but it's not your usual mistake. I'm sure you were just caught off guard, weren't you? I know it's strange for me to say this, but until the final decision is made, you shouldn't let your guard down. ,,
 The game was a very pathetic one, with one of the players in the lead and the rest of us just watching with our fingers crossed. The first time I saw the game, I thought it was a very good game, and I was very happy with the result.
 The first time I played, I was in the same position as the other players, but I was in the same position as the other players, and I was in the same position as the other players. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a good time, but I'm sure it's a good idea to have a good time.
 The best way to get a good result is to play the game with a good hand. The best feeling is when you hit the right tile. I want to do the same as you and make many Tsumo, Agari many times. ,,,
In the game just now, you had a very strong pull. It was as if you knew exactly what was coming. I admire you for having both good reading and good luck. The probability of a single Tsumo is quite high.
 The probability of a one-shot winning is quite low, but you've decided on it several times during the course of the game, that's great strength of pull ......, or should I say brilliance of instinct? The first time I played, I was in the middle of a game, and I was in the middle of a game. You've done a great job. The first time I saw a player, I thought, "I'm not going to let him go.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure you have the right car. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. I'm here,......," he said.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not going to be able to get the best out of your car. The best way to get a good score is to play the game with a good hand. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be a good player.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure that it is not a car that you are going to be driving. I'm sure you were also saddened by the poor luck this time, weren't you? It seems that you both were not so lucky. ......,,
 The first time you play, you're going to get a win, but then you're going to have to swing and give up your winnings. ...... This time, there was a vicious cycle that stood out. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your game is to be a good player, and to be a good player. ,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play. The best way to win is to think about defence. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play. I don't mean that in a bearish way, ......,, but in a positive way.
 I'm jealous of how well you're doing. The best way to do that is to get a good, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean. I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure you're right. ,,,
The game now, there were a lot of Ron-Awari. When a tile comes out the way you want it to, it makes you feel like, "Okay!  You feel like you've got it. The game is a great way to get a good feeling about the game, but it's not a great way to get a good feeling about the game. ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the game is not a game of chance, it is a game of chance. The fact that you can bypass such a network of precautions and decide to make a one-shot Ron, you're amazing. You must be using some kind of supernatural power. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 If you make a one-shot and then flip one more, your payout doubles. The only thing that is important is to avoid one-shot, so everyone is trying to avoid one-shot. ......, how can you just take it for granted that you can make a one-shot Ron? I am very curious and envious of you. ,,
 I was sweating cold during the whole ...... game because every tile I discarded was your winning tile. It's terrible to target a weak player like me,......, no, it's an ironclad rule of the game to take from the weak. You must reflect on your own weakness. ......
 You attack me intensively. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not the only one who is getting the best out of your car. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a good time, but I'm sure it's a good idea to have a good time.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your game is to be careful. You should play around a little more carefully and avoid swinging in, I think. ......,,,,
 How can a player have the skill to extract Ron Tiles from other players and be so careless with his own discarded tiles? I think it's easy enough for someone as skilled as you in "reading" to detect dangerous tiles. ......,,,,
 The game was a very good one, but I think it's a little bit too much. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, it's about the player and the game is about the player.
The most important thing to remember is that the player is not the only one who has to be careful with his or her tiles. The most important thing is that you should not cut too many risky tiles. ,.
 The best way to get the most out of the game is to play the game with a good amount of luck. The best way to do this is to use the best mahjong players. The only time you should avoid it is immediately after riichi. The only time you should be careful is right after riichi. The first time you play a hand, you should be very careful.
 The only time you should play it safe is when you have one shot, such as when you are cutting the actual object. The most important thing is to be careful when you are playing, even if it is inevitable that you will have to make a move. ,,
 I am very grateful for the many transfers this time. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. I think I can have a good match in the next game. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
 I never dreamt that you would assist me. It may have been a mere incidental ...... trouble for you, but for me it was a great pleasure. I am sincerely grateful to you. ......,,,
 The game you just played had a lot of narukis. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the game, it's about the game itself. The best way to get a win is to use a hand with a single flip of the hand, but it is better not to use more than necessary. The following is a list of the most important moves in the game.
 The best way to make a move is to use Naru, but if you expose your hand too much, it will make it harder for you to advance. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the game is not a game, but a game that is played in the same way that the game is played in the same way that the game is played in the same place.
It was a terrible game, with a series of big moves and a lot of swinging. I'm a weak player, so I didn't feel like living. The game was a terrible game. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,but
 The first time I saw a hand that big in a row, I thought it was a rare occurrence. The more intense the movement of the score, the more exciting the game, but for me it was a bit too stimulating. ,,,
 The score changes so much that you don't know who's going to win until the very end. The best way to get a good idea of what to expect is to look at the game and see what you can get out of it. I also need to gain more experience. ......,,,
 The first time I went to a game of Mahjong, I was in the middle of a fight with a guy who was playing with me. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure that it is not a car that you are going to be driving. The first time I played, I was in the middle of a fight with a player who was in the middle of a fight. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 The time required for the game was very long because there were a lot of games going on. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the game is a very good one. The game was not so easy to win, however, and I didn't want to swing in. I think that the Null station might have been the best for me. ......
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your game is to be a good player. The first time I played, I felt like that several times. It's a bit sad, isn't it? ......,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure that you have a good balance between your money and your time. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play with the same hand and expect to get the same results as you would with the same hand. ,,
 The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you're doing. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. The game was a lot of dyed-in-the-wool moves, and everyone was on the lookout. I want to learn from that confidence. ,,
Toy is a very simple hand, but if the dora is good, it can turn into a big hand at once. I think it is a very attractive role. The game is very simple and simple to play, but if the dora is good, it can turn into a big hand in a heartbeat. ,,,
 Toys can be played by anyone, so it seems easy to play, but it is not that easy to collect 3 tiles with only 4 tiles. In fact, it may be a surprisingly difficult role. ,,,,
 No matter how cheap the hand is, if you keep playing, you will eventually get a lot of points. The most important thing is to keep on finishing, even if it's a little cheap. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, it's about the player. I'm not sure what you're talking about.
 The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good chance of getting a thousand points. The first priority is to win in order to get close to the top. The best way to get to the top is to go for it. The best way to get to the top is to know the rules, but it's not easy to put them into practice. The best way to do this is to use a good, clean, and well-designed game plan.
 The best way to get the most out of your phone is to use a mobile phone. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best of the best. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but in my case, the speed at which I think in my head doesn't come with the luck ......,,,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be a good, honest, and reliable businessman. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be a good player. I'm sorry to hear that. ,,
 MARK06
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the game. And right in front of my eyes!  I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't accept this as a challenge, can I? In the name of the Tsuruya school of mahjong, I accept the challenge!  ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go to the store and buy a new pair of shoes. The first time I went to the airport, I was told that I would have to go to China and start my mahjong training all over again. ,,,
Congratulations on your yakuman!  You're so good at yakuman that you beat me to it. How would you like to be my disciple? I'll try to master the art of mahjong with you!  ,,,,
 I made a huge mistake when I swung a yaku mang and then got skipped over. The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who has a rival who can intimidate you,......, so you'll have to settle up sooner or later!  ,,,
 Did you see my brilliant feat? The daredevil who defies me is doomed to be a wreck. You shouldn't have crossed me either. If you don't want to shorten your life, you'd better go to ......,,,
 The only thing you need to be aware of is that you are not the only one who has been doing this. The next time you play, you're going to have to go back to the game. I'll win the next game, I'll win yaku-man!  ,,,
 The next game, I'm going to win yaku man with my next game!  The best way to get a good result is to use the best tiles you can find. Hmm, wrong analogy. ......,,,
 The only thing that matters is that you are not in a position to make a decision!  You're not tense enough, are you? Next time I see you dawdling, I'll give you a Tsuruya-style fist pump to get you fired up. ,,,
 I'm not a good person. I'm not a kid compared to me!  The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing, you'll know that it's a good thing. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your time is to be a good sporting person. I understand how painful it is. The best way to do this is to be a good person, and to be a good person. Don't be depressed!  ,,,,
 I've been blown away, haven't I? I may have underestimated your abilities. I didn't think you could even reach my feet, but you might be at my ankles. ......,,,,
You're quite a clever one, skipping over the enemy and settling the game. I'm starting to think a little bit more about you. But, you know, you're not a real thing until you make me say, "Oh, no!  I'm not a real person until you make me say, "Oh, my God!  ,,,,
 I'm not sure if you've seen the game before, but I think it was a bit too much. The first time I played, I was in the middle of a game. I'm sure you'll learn in the next game what kind of misery you'll face later on if you get carried away and waste your luck!  ,,
 You showed overwhelming strength, didn't you? I thought that my exclusive right to win by myself was my speciality, but it's so frustrating. I'll congratulate you on your victory this time. ,,,,
 This time I had no part to play. ......,It was your own stage, you know. I'm not sure I thought you'd make it this far. I'm not sure I've ever seen you do that before. The first time I went to the beach, I saw a lot of people. I'll be careful!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 The first place win in the current game is quite a strong victory, isn't it? The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first place is the top spot in the tournament, and the second place is the top spot in the tournament. ,,
 I'm so frustrated that I lost to you when I had the chance to be the best, I'm almost in tears. I'm a phoenix. I'll use this frustration as a springboard to be reborn as an even stronger female mahjong player!  ,,,
 I never thought I'd be upstaged in the end. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time I saw her, I thought she was going to be a great player. The best way to get a good result is to get a good idea of what you want to achieve and then make the right decision. The road of mahjong training is still very steep.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not the only one. I'm not the type to hold onto things forever, but I don't think I'll get over being angry at least once in a game. ...... ,,
I'm not a fan of the kind of thing you do. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to win is to make sure you get a cheap hand and score a lot of ...... points, but if you ask me, a cheap hand is meaningless!  I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's not a bad idea!  I couldn't win, so I'm not very convincing. ......,,
 The best way to win is to make a big move, inflict a lot of damage on the other players, both mentally and in terms of points, and then just win!  It was an ideal winning pattern, wasn't it? It was an ideal winning pattern, wasn't it? The best way to win is to show that you are a strong player!  The big one was a big one.
 The big one was a clear winner, wasn't it? I'm good at one-hit kills, but I've been deprived of my stock, no? I'm not a big fan of the big one, but I'm not a big fan of the small ones either. I'll repay you with a more powerful blow!  ,,,
 I'm not sure I'll be able to do it again. I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get a good result. You'll get stronger, I'm sure!  I'm sure you'll get stronger, but it will be difficult to surpass me, I'm sure. ,,,
 I was driven to the edge of the Hakoten, and I thought I would fly away soon, but you stayed until the end. I thought I'd be pushed to the brink of the finish, and I thought I'd jump right away, but I stayed on till the end. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to do it again, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it again!  ,,
 I'm sure you must be disappointed to have been upset in the end and to have fallen to last place. Excuse me. But you were careless too, weren't you? You've got to fight till the end, or you'll get knocked back again!  ,,
 The last heroine to appear on the scene and steal all the good ...... parts is a real heroine with a different kind of coolness. The first time I saw her, I thought she was a real heroine. You're glad you got to see the good stuff, too, right? Oh, why do you look so angry, Nyoro? Hey,, hey, hey, hey.
During the game, I was wondering when you were going to turn the tables on me. If your luck had been a little thicker, I might have lost. ......, but in reality, I was the top. I'm better than you, after all!  ,,
 I let my opponents hope that I could turn the tables on them. The best way to win is to keep your opponents hoping that you might be able to turn the tables on them, and then you end up running away with it. The best way to win is to show the difference in strength and prestige. I'm not going to let you down. ,,
 I'm not a true strongman unless I have the strength to win close and mixed battles. In that sense, I, who lost the current close game, still have a lot of training to do. I'm going to use this frustration as a springboard for further mahjong training!  I'm going to try to get back to the top," he said.
 I was just one step away from the top, but I couldn't reach it. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play with the same old, same old!  The first time I went to the track, I was in the middle of the road, and I was in the middle of the road!  I'm going to do 1,000 push-ups! 
 The first time I went to the gym, I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night. The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do it. I'm not going to let you down!  ,,,
 You screwed up at the last minute. You're not strong enough, that means you're not careful. You mustn't let your guard down until the moment victory is confirmed. You never know what might happen!  ,,,,
 The best way to get the most out of your time at the airport is to go to the airport and check out the airports. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not going to be able to get the best out of your car. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be honest.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure that it is not a car that will be used for a long time. I know that the game is different for each individual and the timing is different, but the difference between the two was too great to make a move.
How can you hit so many tiles? I have confidence in my luck too, but it's hard for me to make that many times ......, maybe you have better luck than me ......? ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do it. The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the difference between the two. I hated him because he was so good. The next time, it won't be like this!  ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be able to use it. I think it's best not to go against lucky people for a while, you know, ......,,.
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to get the best out of the game. The most important thing is that you have to be careful. The best way to get a good result is to get a good idea of what you're looking for. I'm sure you'll be able to find a way. ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not going to be able to get a car that will not be able to get out of the car!  ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play. The first thing to do is to make sure that you are not the only one who can do it. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car!  The first hand is the only way to win.
 The best way to get a good score is to make the first move before the opponent makes a move. I would say that you are swinging too many times a day, more than twice a day!  The best way to get a good score is to play the same game over and over again!  You've got to be on the offensive to win.
 You have to be aggressive to win, of course, but you can't throw away tiles recklessly. You're losing a lot of money by carelessly discarding tiles. Attack while defending. You can't win at mahjong if you don't play with the balance in mind!  ,,
You were in such great shape that I couldn't keep up with you. You were in such good form that you kept on going on and on and on, so I didn't have a chance to appear. I don't mind giving you the lead once in a while, though. ......,.
 The joy of the moment when you hit the right tile is the best, isn't it? The best thing is that you can get a good deal on the game. But this time, you got the best of me and I didn't have any fun at all. ......,,
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to read the situation. You have to be very sharp in your reading to do that well. I'll see which is sharper, your reading or my hawk-like ...... senses, and we'll settle it in the next game!  ,,
 The first game is a big loss, so everyone is trying to avoid the first shot ......, but your technique of making a one-shot Ron, cutting through the gap, is really brilliant. The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do it. The best way to get the best out of your own home is to get a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal of things!  You're a good player, you're a good player.
 I'm not sure how many times I was wrong to swing at you in the last game. I'm sure you didn't think I was the one you were aiming at, did you? I don't think you've got the technique or the balls to do that, though. ......,,,
 I'm not sure you've got the technique or the balls to take a shot at me, but you've got a lot of balls, don't you? I'm not sure you have the guts to do that, but you've got a lot of guts, don't you? I've got a heart as big as the sky, so I won't get angry so easily. ......, maybe. ......,,
 I'm not going to get angry with you. If you keep on swinging like that, you're going to lose all the points you've earned. If you want to win, don't swing in. If you want to win, don't swing in. The same applies to the following types of games:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to play with a lot of confidence. The best way to get a good score is to play with a good hand. If you want to get to the top, you have to avoid swinging!  You've got to avoid swinging! 
Why do you carelessly cut the right tiles? You haven't had enough practice in detecting dangerous tiles based on the discarded tiles and the situation on the table, have you? The best way to learn from your mistakes is to learn from your mistakes, so swing a lot and learn what's bad with your body!  ,,.
 To win, you need to have the guts to play even a slightly risky tile without fear, but cutting a tile that anyone can see is a sure thing is just a suicide mission. If you have nothing else to cut but such a tile, it's part of the game to go for it. It's better than dying, isn't it? If you have a good hand, you can win the game.
 If you take a swing, you'll get a flip you don't have to make. It's the most ridiculous thing you can do, isn't it? So you have to avoid 1,000 flips at all costs. It's also important to leave all the cheap tiles in case the other player reaches. ,,.
 If someone reaches, you have to play it safe and avoid one-shot. Cut as many safe tiles as you can, such as the actual, fourth face tile ......, so that you don't get a one-shot loss!  ,,,
 I'm really grateful to you for swinging at me so many times during the game. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use a different method. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'd be happier to have a game with you than to have you transfer money to me on purpose!  You're not going to transfer money to me again and again, are you?
 You're trying to get me to transfer the money again and again, ...... so that you can get a better chance? The best way to do this is to use the same kind of tools that you use for your own personal use. I'll play fair and square in the name of the Tsuruya school, so come on, you guys, give it your all!  I'll give it my all! 
 Mahjong is interesting to make a hand without ringing. If you immediately ring the tiles you want, you won't be able to train your power of winning, will you? You can't train your power of Tsumo if you immediately ring the tiles you want, can you? This is the basic rule. Don't ring too many tiles!  ,,,
In a battle, if you carelessly reveal your hand, you will be at a disadvantage. It is the same in mahjong. If you reveal your hand by ringing, your aim will be read and it will be difficult to win. It is better to fight without ringing as much as possible!  The game is a lot of fun.
 It was a fierce battle with a lot of big hands. Mahjong is not exciting if you don't make big hands. The best way to get a good result in mahjong is to play a big hand!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 The game was a hot one, just the way I like it, with such big hands in a row. The best way to get a good idea of what you're getting into is to look at the website and see what's going on. ,,,,
 The game was a fierce battle between the best players, and it didn't matter who won, it was a great battle. The best way to get a good result is to play a game of mahjong!  I'm a lucky man to have such good opponents like you!  ,,,
 The current game was a battle royale, with four players fighting to the death. The next time you play, you'll be in a hot battle like this. I'm looking forward to another hot battle like this next time!  ,,,,
 The game took too long because there were a lot of lapses. I don't like it when the focus is on one person, but it's even more annoying when all four players are playing with no decisive moves. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to play the game, but if I get back to my usual form, the game will be over in no time, so there can't be any lopsided games. ......,.
 The game was a lot of lapses and the tension was lowered. I can't be in a game where I can't win, and it's impossible for me to be in a game where I can't win!  Sometimes when I finish with no-ten, I'm so shocked that I can't see straight,......, and anyway, I can't have no more games. The best way to get a good result is to play mahjong!  The best way to get a good result is to play mahjong.
 The best way to do this is to stick to one thing at a time. It's important to have that attitude. In mahjong, it's great to collect the same kind of tiles thoroughly. I'm not a fan of that!  In my case, I don't want to rely on other people's discarded tiles, but I also want to collect tiles by myself. ......,
If you decide to collect tiles of a certain type, you dye them to the hilt. When you stick to your intention even if people around you notice you and block your way, and you finish your dyed hand, your hand will shine brighter than your score!  I'm going to keep trying to make more and more dyed-in-the-wool moves!  ,,.
 The best way to get a good result is to play the toi, toi is one of the options, but I'd like to aim for the ultimate form of toi, toi ......, i.e. four concealed triplets. The higher the hurdle, the more worthwhile the challenge!  ,,,
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use a handmade toy, but it's a very easy role that doesn't require a lot of brainpower!  I'm not sure I'd be able to do it!  If you want to be an expert like me, you should change your tendency to play with toys immediately!  ,,,
 If you want to become a master, like me, you should change your tendency to play toys right away. The best way to win is to aim for a big hand and kill your opponent with a single blow, rather than saving up a few points. Mahjong to show, that's the Tsuruya way!  The first hand is the best.
 The best way to win is to make sure you get even 1,000 points by playing fast, and then seize victory in the end. ...... It's a solid way to play, but it's too dreamy. The best way is to get a good score, even if it's only one in a thousand, and win at the end!  ,,,
 Get up fast and get out of there. Your fighting style is very sharp now, isn't it? I'm not sure if I'm right or wrong, but I'm not sure. ,,
 The best way to win at mahjong is to go up as fast as you can, but if you play cheap hands all the time, you run the risk of being upset by a single big hand. The best way to play is to combine both speed and points. I'm going to aim for that and train hard today, too!  ,
 MARK07
You did a really good job, Yaku-Man Tsumo. I was not mistaken in my judgment when I saw that you had something to offer. I hope you will not be complacent about this result, and continue to make further progress. I will also be supporting you from the shadows at ......,,.
 The first time I saw the game, I thought it would be a good idea to have a look at it. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that you are a good player. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that you are a good player. No, I admire you. I'm impressed.
 I never thought I'd be sent away with a yakuza. I have a fair amount of experience in mahjong, but this is probably the first time I've had such a shocking experience. I've never had such a shock before. I've never thought that I'd be able to play Yakuman.
 I never thought I would win a yakuza. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be honest with yourself, and to be honest with yourself. (Computer says no?) I was going to settle the game with yakuman, but I was tempted by yakuman.
 The first time I saw the game, I thought it would be a good idea to have a game. I, too, do not dislike such dramatic endings. I am looking forward to the next one with such a dramatic ending. I am watching as a spectator at ......,,
 I have seen some very unusual things. The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the whole picture. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure that you have the best possible deal. The same is true for the other two.
 It wasn't like you that you couldn't get up at least once. You were in a bad way, weren't you? If you play mahjong for a long time, there are times when your luck gives up on you. The best way to do this is to be patient and wait for your recovery. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
I think I've gotten a little too hot for my own good. I'm sorry for what I did to you. I've been trying to stay calm all the time, but when it comes to mahjong, I seem to get carried away sometimes. ...... I'm so embarrassed. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play mahjong.
 The best way to get the most out of your time in the game is to play the game you want to play. The best way to do this is to use the time you have left in your life. I hope you will use your frustration as a springboard to face the next game. I will support you from the shadows. ......,,,
 I have been playing mahjong for a long time, but I still haven't found a sure-fire way to win. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your mahjong game is to be prepared for the unexpected. ,,,
 The last blow was really brilliant. The best thing about the game is that it's not a game that you can play. I am very happy that I was not in the position to be sent away. I have to calm down. ......,,,
 I'm not sure I've ever seen such a streak before, but it was far more than I expected. I'm so glad you're here. I was surprised. I'm not sure if I'll be able to play with you in the next game, but I'll have to take measures to stop the streak. ......? ,,,
 The game was won in a spectacular way. The first game of the season was the first game of the season in which I won the first game of the season. The only thing is, I think it's best not to get carried away. Life and mahjong are always a little bit in the dark. ......,,,
 Congratulations on winning the top prize. I was impressed by your unparalleled and overwhelming strength. The next time I fight you, I'm going to be a little more careful with my weapons. I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to do, but I'm going to have to raise my difficulty level a bit the next time I fight you. ......,,
 I was amazed at your brilliant move to get out of the race and win the top spot in the rapidly shifting standings. I was surprised at his brilliant move and skill to win the top position. I will win the next game. ,,,
I had my chance to win, but I couldn't attack. I never underestimated your strength, but I am surprised at how strong you are. I am surprised at how strong you are, but next time I will have to fight harder. ...... ,,,
 The last time I was up against a team, it was an unexpected outcome. The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have the right equipment and the right team. We have to reflect on this so we don't make the same mistake again. ......,,,
 I was sure I could defend my top position, but to be dragged down in the end, it's so frustrating and pathetic,......, I can't stop playing the game with an upset loss. Now, let's continue. ......!  ,,
 The first two players were the first to win the tournament, and the second to win the tournament. The first time I played in the tournament, I was in the top position. The best way to win is to start small and work your way up,....... ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to win is to play the cheapest moves that are easy to win, rather than aiming for the big moves that are hard to win, even though the score is big. It was a very solid way of fighting. The game was a good one, but I also support that way of fighting. The top player was the one who won the tournament.
 The top position with the least amount of moves is really efficient and lean. The best way to win is to make sure you have the skill to make a big move when the time is right. The best thing about the game is that it's a winning turn. ,,,
 The best way to win is to make big moves at key moments, secure the lead, and then get away with it ......, in a way that is so comfortable that it's almost loathsome. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see a new player, you know he's going to be a good player. I'd like to learn from you, too.
 I almost got blown up, didn't I? I'd like to learn from you, too. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but the fact that you stayed on is proof that there's still a chance. I'm sure you'll be able to get back on track next time. ,,
To survive to the end despite being driven to the brink,...... is quite tenacious, isn't it? The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of a game is to be patient. The most important thing to remember is that you are not alone. ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the game itself, but about the players themselves, and that the game is not about the players themselves. I apologise. From now on, I will be careful. ......,,,
 The first time I went to the airport, I saw a lot of people who were there, but I didn't think that I would end up taking you from the top to the bottom. ,(Machine disappoints again),,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be honest with yourself. I am not old enough to be bothered, but I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your kindness. ,,,
 I'm not sure if I'm the best, but I could have been upset at any time, so I couldn't let up until the very end. I thought you could turn the tables at any time, ......, but I guess that means I have a chance now, too. ,,,
 The first time I went to the race, I was in the lead, but I didn't know who would come out on top until the very end. The best way to get the best out of the game is to play the game with the best players. The first time I played in the tournament, I was in the top 10. ,,,
 The best way to get a good result in mahjong is to play a game that is not too difficult, but not too difficult to win. ,,,
 I'm the one who came out on top this time, but it just so happened that I was lucky, and I think you are better than me in terms of ability. So, there is no need to be shocked. You can play the next game with confidence. ,,
I'm sorry, but I had to take the top spot in reverse. I couldn't pass up the perfect opportunity to take the top ......, so I hope you understand my feelings of being dedicated to the competition and don't get angry with me, but ......,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm sorry.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your mahjong game is to play it. ,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be careful when you are playing. The first time I went to the beach, I saw a lot of people, but I didn't know what they were talking about. I'm sure I'll get my chance next time.
 I think there were a lot of Tsumo aari this time. I'm confident in my defensive abilities, but I can't help it if I'm getting picked off. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you play, you'll be the first to know. The first time I played, I was in the middle of a fight.
 The first time you played, the first time you played, the first time you played, the first time you played. I'm not going to let go of that luck. If you don't let go of that luck, you'll never lose. But luck is fickle. Do not be too proud. ......,,,
 You have experienced the feeling of despair ...... when you get a one-shot winning hand, haven't you? The best way to do this is to make sure that you are not a victim of the same thing. The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who has been through it. ,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful. The only thing you can't control with experience or technique is luck, so you have to lament your own lack of it. ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful what you spend your money on. The most important thing is that you have to be able to do it. Even at my age, I still can't accept this. This time it was a real disappointment. ......,,,
The most important thing to remember is to be careful not to swing and to play cautiously, but it is really frustrating when you get a lucky pick. The best way to get a good result, however, depends on the luck of the draw. In the end, the one who fights carefully wins. Don't forget that. ......,,
 Even if you have made a lot of money with Tsumo Agari, it's meaningless if you have swung in. You should not waste a good Tsumo flow. You should think a little more carefully about your discarded tiles, ......,,.
 The best way to get a good result is to play a game of mahjong. The game is a good one, but it's not easy to win, no matter how good your luck is. You have to be more focused on the game. ......,,
 You have the technique ...... to read other players' hands and psychology and draw out your own winning tiles. The name "master" is only fitting for you!  The name "master" is exactly what you deserve!  ,,
 The best way to get a good result is to use the best of the best and the best of the worst. If it was just luck, there would be no need to be afraid. ......,,,
 The first time I saw you, I thought you were a very good player, but then I realised that you were a very good player. The most important thing is that you have to be able to get the best out of the game. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be the best you can be. The more you play, the higher your one-shot rate is. You are a terrible person. ......,,
 The best way to do this is to reach out with an unexpected waiting position that the other players can't anticipate, and make a one-shot strike. ...... The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be a good player. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you play mahjong, you will be the first person to win the game. I'm not a novice.
The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the game is a game of chance. It's hard to imagine that I would have swung at you so many times on my own, so ......, of course it's possible that I just had very bad luck, but if that's the case, it's a shameful story. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time I saw the film was in the UK. ,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. The most important thing is that the people who are in charge of the project are the ones who are in charge of the project. Resistance is pointless ......, it was really scary. The next time you play, I hope you'll be out of this hellhole. ,,
 The number of Ron-agari and the number of Furikomi-mi are almost the same. The game was a good one, but the game was not so good. The first time I played, I was in the lead, but I was not in the lead. I don't understand. I don't understand it, I don't understand it.
 The game is a waste of time and money. It's a waste. The tiles are not in the same place as the tiles in the other hand, so you should choose your discarded tiles more carefully. It's not like you're a beginner who can't read the other player's waiting. ......,,
 The game was played with a lot of transfers. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of tools that you would use in your own game, and to use them in a way that is not only safe, but also effective. ,,.
 If you are late in the game, it is wise to be on the lookout for someone else's tempei, even if you don't have a reece, and to turn any tiles that look risky. There are times when it is more correct to bet-ORI than to swing in. ......,,,, Why do you repeatedly swing in one shot?
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to take the time to do the right thing. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to use it. It's not necessary to cause more senseless damage, ......? ,,,
 The first time you make a transfer, I think it's quite a shock, both in terms of points and spirit, but you're a very strong person, you're able to stand up again and again without being discouraged. It's really wonderful. ,,,
I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me to go up and down again and again. I am very grateful to you for helping me to get away from my risings many times. Your thoughtful and considerate actions will one day bring happiness to yourself. ,,,
 I was surprised to receive such a large amount of money from you. The most important thing is that you should not be afraid of the people you meet. I'm not sure if it was a good idea or not, but I'd like to thank you in any case. I'd like to thank you, in any case. ,,
 I think it's one thing to finish it with a squeal. The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you're doing. The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to ask for help. ......,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of a game is to play it in the best possible way. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your handmade handmade jewelry is to use a good quality handmade jewelry. ,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not the only one. I think it's a good thing that the game is so calm, because when you're my age, it's better to fight more calmly. ......,,,,,
 The game was a fierce battle of big moves clashing with big moves. The next game, I hope for an adult fight where the game is decided by bargaining. ,,,
 The next game will be an adult game, where the game will be decided by tactics. The next game, I hope, will be an adult game where the game is decided by bargaining. It may have been an interesting match, but personally I am not good at intense, fast-paced fights, so I was a bit tired. ......,,,,
 The game was an exciting one, with everyone giving it their all. I was also unusually excited. I was more than twice as tired as usual thanks to that,......, but mahjong with young people is too much of a sting, too intense. ,,,
This time, there were a lot of nullified games and it took a lot of time. Thanks to that, I am more tired than usual. I'm not sure if I'll be able to play the next game early, so I'll try to settle the game early. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but there's nothing more frustrating than paying no-ten penalties in a game that's over. ......,,,
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the game is a very good one. The game was not very exciting. I prefer quiet games as much as possible, but it's also a problem when the games are all over the place. ,,,,
 The game was very good, but the game was not very good. I recognised it immediately. I think other people have probably noticed that too,......, but still you dare to stick to dyed hands. I don't dislike it. I don't dislike it.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your product is to make sure that it is not a product that is going to be used for a long time to come. I think there must be a reason why they are so particular about their dyed hands. ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be a good listener. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you have the right car. The game is played in the same way as mahjong, with the same rules and the same players.
 The game of Mahjong is a game where you can enjoy a handmade hand with a higher score while predicting the flow of Tsumo. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, it's about the player and the game. The most important thing is to make sure that you have a good time.
 The most important thing is that you should be able to see the difference between the two. I think that's the right way to think. However, it is no good just getting up once, you need to have the luck and skill to win a lot of hands in a row. ......,,,,
 I think it is a great technique to quickly win with a cheap hand without taking a long time. The best way to get a good score is to play a lot of hands in a row. The best way to get a good score is to play mahjong. ,,,
I couldn't do anything if he went up that fast. I didn't even have time to be surprised. I was so fast that I had no time to even be surprised. I can only remember my younger days and use my brain to the fullest. ......,,,,
 I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to get the best out of your car. The first time I saw a woman in a bikini, I thought, 'I'm going to have to go to the beach. I'll get back into it so that I can make up for it in the next battle. ......,...
 MARK08
 The first time I went to a golf club, I was very impressed with the quality of the products and the service. I'm sure it's the result of your daily devotion. I hope you will continue to devote yourself to the game and aim for even greater heights. I am sure you can go even higher. ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do this. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be honest with yourself. I am surprised. You've grown into quite a skilled player, haven't you?
 I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do that, but I'm sure you'll be able to do it. The best way to get a good result is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you're doing and how to do it. ,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play mahjong and not be able to get away with it," he said. I think I might have to start my training all over again,......,,,,.

The fact that you have a full flush shows that your hand and Tsumo are pretty bad,......, which means that you have lost your luck, doesn't it? I think it's not the time to be happy about it,......,,,,.
 The game was a good one, but I think it's a bit of a letdown. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play with the same hand and expect to get the same results as you would if you were playing with the same hand. If that doesn't work, then it's your lucky day. ......,.
 Do you know why the game turned out the way it did? The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing, you will be surprised. It's just that the difference in ambition to be better is the result. If you want to become stronger, aim higher!  ,,
 I'm more than a little disappointed with the current results. I still need more training. But you don't have to be depressed. Mahjong and fighting both grow stronger through setbacks. This defeat will be your food for thought!  ,,.
 I never imagined that you would fly me to defeat. ......, I didn't expect it, which means that I was too proud. I am more ashamed of that than of losing. I have to reflect on that. ......,,,
 The final blow was dealt, wasn't it? I can see that you are getting better and better day by day. But the world is still up there. I hope you will not settle for the status quo and will continue to make further progress!  ,,,
 The synergy between ability and luck produces a storm of Dachan Chan. The best way to get the best out of your car is to buy a car that has a good price tag. You should ride the momentum when you're on a roll. The best way to do this is to be careful not to be too proud and self-destructive. ......,,,,
 I'm not sure how much money you've made, but you've made a lot. The best way to do this is to be a good sport. I'm sure you've mastered the technique of turning luck on your side and rising to the top in one fell swoop. It was a brilliant victory. ,,
In the game just now, there was enough vigour to take away everyone's scorecards. This must be the result of your daily training. It was wonderful. You may be able to surpass me and reach even greater heights. ......,,,,
 The battle was fierce, with the positions changing rapidly. You have won this battle because you excelled in your competitive spirit. If you lose because of your strength, then I am no longer in a position to be a matchmaker. Let's fight again and settle this!  ,,
 In mahjong and fighting, it is said that the really strong never lose in a close game. In the end, it is the bottom line that counts. I see that you have a lot of bottom strength, having won this close game. I may have to show you my bottom line, too. ......,,
 I didn't know you could do such a terrible thing, kicking me down to get to the top. I must reflect on my own naivety in not seeing your true nature. ......,,,,
 I was so sure I was going to win, and then I fell behind you at the last minute. ...... I am amazed at your keen insight and ability to see the slightest flaws in my mind. I'm still a work in progress.
 I'm not sure I'd be able to do it if I didn't have a good relationship with the people I work with. The first time I saw him, I thought he was a good player. The first thing to do is to make sure that you are not in a position where you have to fight with a lot of people," he said. The best way to fight is to use your jab to find out how your opponent is going to react and then use your strength to cut down his strength. The best way to fight is to use your jab to find out what your opponent is going to do.
 The best way to win is to aim for the top while accumulating cheap moves, but if you play a big hand against your opponent, you will be in trouble at once. When you are aiming for a cheap move, always be careful of your defences!  ,,,,
 The joy of winning a big hand is something you can experience over and over again. It is the same in mahjong. I love the feeling of elation when I get a manzan, haneman or treble manzan. You looked very happy just now, too. ......,,,
He made a big move, jumped to the top and went on to win. It was a very logical and logical winning pattern, wasn't it? The first time I saw him, I thought he was a good fighter. ,,,,,
 The first time I saw a game like this, I thought it would be a great game. It's fortunate that it didn't fly away, that's for sure. But you must reflect on the fact that you were driven to this point. I hope you'll be more careful in the next game. ,,,
 I am very proud of your persistence in persevering to the end, even though you were almost blown away. The team's goal was to win the tournament, but they did not give up until the end. Your stubbornness will surely come in handy in the future when you are in a pinch. ,,
 I hope you have not let your guard down because you thought you could escape from me. Unfortunately, I am not so naive. I'm not that naive. I've been laying low, waiting for a chance to turn the tables. I was on my guard. You must not let your guard down until the very end!  ,,
 You were so sure of your victory that you didn't even think about me. But if I really wanted to, it would be easy enough to drag you from the top to the bottom. Let me give you these words. Know your way up!  I'm almost there, I'm almost at the top.
 You've come so close to taking me to the top. But the last little bit is hard to reach. I'll be watching your growth closely at ......, to see if you overtake me easily, or if you stagnate. ,,
 I'm sorry you didn't make it one step further. But during the game, I always felt a strong pressure from you. I could feel that you were developing a strong power. You can't afford to be complacent. ......,,
 The first time I saw the first time I saw the second time I saw the third time. It's a pity. ......, you probably feel the same way. The next game, we'll try to make up for it. ,,
I made a mistake in the last minute and missed the top. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the game of mahjong is a very difficult one, and that it is not only a game of skill, but also a game of fear and depth. ...... ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be the best you can be. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'd like you to aim higher still. I hope you can still aim higher, but for that reason, I had to turn the tables on you. I hope you won't be offended. ,,,
 Do you know why you lost this game? I'm sure you've become stronger, but from my point of view, you still have a long way to go. But from my point of view, you're still full of flaws. You are still full of flaws, especially in the tsume-me. I want you to fight until the end, without losing heart. ,,,
 The luck is like a raging wave that cannot be resisted no matter what measures you take. The only thing you can do when you encounter someone with such luck is to quietly wait for the waves to pass by. No matter how much you are overrun,......, it is frustrating, but now you have to endure and wait for your chance. ,,
 The other three players could not do anything, it was a nightmarish game. The other three players could not do anything. The luck is terrible. ......,,,
 The power to attract winning tiles one after another. The best way to do this is to use the right tools. I'm not sure, but if you've mastered it so completely, I have to unleash my hidden power too. ......,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do this, and that you are not the only one who can do it. ,,,,,
 I was surprised. The first time I played, I was very surprised to see how many times you made the ippatsu tsumo in a single game. Even I can't make that many one-shot Tsumo, ......, but if your skill is real and not a temporary lucky break, then I must beat you with all my might. ......,
The next game, I'm going to get up before you reach," he said. The next game, I'm going to get up before you reach!  ,,,
 The next game, I'm going to go for it before you reach!  The only thing that can't be helped is the poverty of being Tsumoed.
 The only thing that can't be helped is the Tsumo Poverty. If you don't swing, but your ranking is low, you really feel empty. I wish there was a technique to stop the momentum of Tsumo. ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to win is to never give up. The best way to win is to never swing at anything. The best way to win is to play the game as it is now, no matter how many Tsumo Agari you win, you can't win. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 The best way to win is to play the game with a good hand, and to play the game with a good hand. The most important thing to remember is that you should not be afraid to play mahjong. The way you are playing now is too defenceless. ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to be a good player to get a good result. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be honest with yourself. I'd like to confirm that, so please give me one more game!  I'm not sure.
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. Why do the right tiles keep coming out just as you want them to? I'm sure there must be some technique. Please teach me how to get the right tiles too!  ,,,
 The first shot is a very difficult one, because it is easy to be wary of it. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of techniques that you have used in the past. I'm not sure if it's just good timing or not, but ......,,.
If you reach too early or too late, it is difficult to hit the right tile at the first shot. You need to find the right moment when the other players' hands have reached a good deadlock. The timing of your hand is very, very precise. ,,,
 You were clearly shooting at me in this game, weren't you? The best way to do that is to concentrate on your opponent, but if you fail to kill him, you know he will strike back, don't you? The best way to do this is to use the right tools. I'm not sure what you're talking about.
 I'm not sure what I did to you, but it seems I've become a good friend of yours. The most important thing to remember is that you should not be afraid to ask for help from your friends and family.
 The first time you play, you will be the first one to get the top prize. The first thing I want to say to you is, if you want to get to the top, don't swing in carelessly. I don't mean to be so blunt with you, but ......,,,,
 How can you cut danger tiles without hesitation? The same way you can't win if you are always trying to win, but you can't win if you are always swinging the same number of times. You should also think about your defence when you play ......? ,,,
 (Untranslated. Bastard.) The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who has to be careful when it comes to your health. The best way to do this is to use the right tools. The first time I saw you, I was in the middle of a fight.
 The first time I saw him, I thought he was a good player, but he was not. The game is not a game of chance, it is a game of chance. You can't win if you don't look at your own hand, but also look at the other players' discarded tiles and be on the lookout for dangerous tiles. ,,,
 It is reckless to play Dangerous Tiles immediately after reaching. Even if you have decided to play hard, you should only play a safe tile at the first shot. Otherwise, you will get seriously hurt, just like this time. ......,,,,
If you swing in one shot, an extra flip will be added and you will suffer a great deal of damage. Did you know this and discard the risky tiles? At least right after riichi, you should be more careful. If you are intentionally trying to lose, that's a different story. ......,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, it is about the player. The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the difference between the two. I would like to thank you. Thank you very much. ,,,
 If it hadn't been for your strike, I would have been in last place and would have lost the game. I'd like to thank you for your kindness. I'm not a fan of the "I'm not a fan of the game" rule, but I'm not a fan of the "I'm not a fan of the game" rule. ,,,
 The game is not to be played with mercy, but it is an effective way of advancing. The best way to do this is to use the same method as in the case of the other two. In your case, I think you may be squeaking a little too much, but ......,,.
 The best way to improve your mahjong skills is to try and make your own handmade tiles without ringing as much as possible. It is important to make an effort to win with only your own Tsumo, instead of immediately ringing the tiles you want. If you are not a good player, you can try to avoid ringing a little bit. ,.
 The game was a thrilling one, with one high move after another. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the players, it's about the players themselves. I am ashamed to say this, but ......,,,
 The game just now, there were a lot of big moves in quick succession, weren't there? The game was very exciting, with a lot of special moves being exchanged. I have to confess that I prefer a fierce battle like the one we just saw to a quiet one. ......,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that it is a good one. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. The next time, let's clash again!  ,,,,,the
In mahjong and sports, it is not interesting to fight an opponent with too great a difference in skill and technique, but the current game was a very interesting battle, with the players' abilities being very close to each other. The game was very interesting because the players were very good at each other's games. The game was very interesting.
 The game was very interesting. I wanted to go up at a good tempo, but I couldn't make any progress ......, so when the game is deadlocked, you may have to force the game forward, even if you have to use a lot of Naru.... ...,,,
 The current game, including myself, seems to have been abandoned by everyone's luck, and there was only a lot of Nullification. I don't like to play in a dead game because I feel like it's a waste of time. I hope the next game won't be like this. ,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your hand is to be flexible. The best thing to do is to be more flexible. ,,,
 You like to dye your hands. The most important thing to remember is that you are not alone in your decision to go for the path you have chosen.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be a good player. Do you also like Dora? ,,,
 The game is a game of collecting identical tiles. To put it bluntly, it is a simple role that beginners like to play. The best way to get a good result is to play with a simple hand. If you want to go higher, you need more handmade training ......,,,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get to the top is to play a lot of games, even if they are cheap hands. However, if you keep playing cheaply, you will lose the game when the other players play big hands. If you are not a good player, you can't win the game. ,.
The cheapest move is to attack quickly in order to get a head start on the other players, but if you don't make a big move afterwards, you risk a reversal. You should not only play cheap hands, but also make your own hand to escape ......,,,,.
 The most important factor in winning a mahjong game is not only how high your score is, but also the speed with which you can win. If you can keep going up every time with the same speed as you did in the current game, you can become an unbeatable mahjong player. ......,,,,
 In the game you just played, you played a series of brilliant fast attacks. The game was a brilliantly fought game in which the reading and the moves were in perfect harmony. I am very proud of you, but I also need more training to catch up with that speed. I'll have to work harder. ...... ,,,

 "Tsumo! " The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the players, it's about the players. I saw it a few times in the previous game, but that kind of thing is called a smug look, isn't it? I'm not sure if I have that look on my face when I'm playing ......,,,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to be a good sport to be a good sport!  I'm not going to be able to do it, but I'm going to be able to do it!  It's really unfair to make a one-shot Tsumo!  ,,,

I'm so frustrated. ......,,,
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a good time. I'm not sure if it's a good thing that I have a good hand, but normally I'd be in last place. The best way to get a good score is to play with a good team!  ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can make a profit. The best way to get a good result is to play the game with a good amount of money. ,,,,
 The first time I saw the game, I thought it was a big deal, but it was not. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see a woman in a bikini, you know that she's going to be wearing a bikini. I'm not sure if it's a good thing, but it's not a bad thing. I'm the only one who's cheating. ......,,,,
The first time I went to the beach, I saw a lot of people. You're pretty good. I've been watching you!  I'll tell you how to do so many longhauls later, secretly. ,,,,,
 The first shot is a big shock, and there are a lot of points to be taken. ...... It's a foul!  I'm not going to let you get away with it!  If you do,......,,,,,
 I think it's very, very difficult to make a one-shot Ron, but how can you do it over and over again? Are you that lucky? Or ...... you can use your psychic powers? ,,,,,
 You were aiming at me in that fight, weren't you? I'm just a kid and it's terrible!  You could have been a little gentler with me, couldn't you? ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get a good night's sleep is to be able to sleep at least once a day. If it's permissible to do that, then it's also permissible for me to be a little bit more extreme with Shami, isn't it? ,,,,
 The best way to get a good result is to get a good result. You have a chance to take the lead, but you can't just throw away ...... the winning tile!  ,,,,
 You're a real bum, swinging in so many times and throwing away all your hard-earned points. The best way to do this is to use the best tiles you can find!  I know that much, don't I? ,,,,
 I'm not sure how much you can take. The most important thing to remember is that you are not alone in your decision making process. ,,,,
 The best mahjong players don't swing too often, do they? I'm not sure how to do it, but I'm sure you can do it. The first thing that comes to my mind is that I'm not a good mahjong player!  I'm not a good mahjong player. The best way to do this is to use a good mahjong player!  ,,,,,
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. I'm sure you'll be fine, though. I'm sure I'd be heartbroken if I were you. ......, you have to be careful!  ,,,,
Hey, hey, one-shot transfers are pretty bad, aren't they? I'm not sure what you're talking about. If you keep doing one-shot transfers, people won't like you, you know? I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure you're right.
 I'm not sure what you're talking about!  I'm not going to be able to do it again. I guess being cute is really good for you~. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. ,,,,,,
 Thank you so much for throwing away my winning tile so many times!  I really like you a lot!  I love you so much!  ,,,,,
 The basic principle of Mahjong is to ring. The more you ring, the faster you can win, and it's great when you get more dora by kan!  The best way to get a good result is to play a lot of games!  ,,,,,
 I'm not a fan of ringing. The best way to get a good idea of how to play is to use the game as a tool to get the most out of the game. I'm not going to be a fan of this!  ,,,
 I was so excited to see all the high hands. I love high hands, and I want to win, but if you keep getting high hands, I'm afraid I'm going to pull back. ......,,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get a good score is to be a good player. The most important thing is that you have to be able to play with a high hand and get a lot of points!  ,,,,
 I was so happy when I got a high hand and got a lot of points. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a video game, but it's a good idea to have a video game. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it was fun!  ,,,,,
 The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you're doing. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm going to do it. I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down!  ,,,,
 The game is so long and tiring. I'm not going to be able to do it. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, it's about the player and the game is about the player!  ,,,
When the game is over, everyone is so disappointed that they can't make any progress at all, and it's very frustrating. And if you're not in the game, it's bad. ......, you have to ring a lot and try to get out early!  The same kind of tiles are used to collect tiles of the same type.
 The best way to get a good result is to use the same kind of tiles. I know how people who often aim for Hongitsu and Chinitsu feel!  It's really nice to dye your hands!  ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to use it!  The best way to do it is to use a good hand!  The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and buy a new pair of shoes!  I love to make big hands with chintsu! 
 I love the feeling of "kita!  I love that feeling!  Toys are really fun, aren't they? I think I'm going to become a toy specialist. You like toy toys?
 You like toy toys? I love toys too!  I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I think it's a good idea!  I'm not a fan of the "toi-toys"!  Only one of us can be in love with you, so that's impossible. ......,,,,
 Why do you always get the cheapest hand? I'm not going to be a part of this!  I'm not going to play with you. Let's go for the high hand!  ,,,,,
 I often ring, but I also ring dora, kan, and try to raise the score a little bit, you know? I'm not a fan of just playing a cheap hand. ,(UNTRANSLATED! ) ,,,,,
 Hey..!  You're coming up too fast!  How can you make it come up so fast? It's not fair!  You're not fair!  ,,,,,
 I'm not sure how you can do it. I tried my best, but I couldn't catch up with you at all. ......,It's against the speed limit to go up that fast. ,,,,,

Yakuman Tsumo? That's pretty good. I'm proud of you, even though you're my enemy!  You must be in a really good mood. I'm very envious of you. ,,,,,
 The first time I saw the game, I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to get to know the players!  How cruel of you to torment such a small, fragile and lovely girl like me!  I'm going to cry now!  ,,,,
 I'm not a fan of the "I'm a good person, I'm a good person!  I'm sure you must be very happy. It's the most important role in Mahjong. I'm sure you must be overjoyed!  I'm sure it's cute that the person who swung the hand is so happy. ......,,,,
 It's the greatest misfortune to be skipped in yakuman. I'm not sure how much I'll be able to do!  I'm not sure if it's a good thing, but it's only by overcoming ordeals like this that people can become big. I, too, will overcome this and grow up!  ,,,
 I'm not sure if you can believe it yourself!  I can't believe it myself. I'm still trembling all over!  I can't believe it!  I'm glad to be alive, even if I'm small in size!  ,,,,
 The first time I saw a man with a Yakuman, it was amazing, wasn't it? The first time I went to a golf club, I was so impressed with the way it was set up. The first time I saw it, I was so impressed with the way it was done. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I think it's a good idea!  The,,,
 I was able to see a rare thing like Nagashi Man-suwan!  I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not, but it's a good thing. The same can be said about life, can't it? I can turn adversity into an opportunity!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
 Was the game you just played poor? I can't believe you couldn't win at least once,......, but don't be discouraged if you mess up a little bit, okay? I'm sure you'll have a chance to come back!  The problem is when you come back. ......,,
I thought I was being modest, but I skipped over it all together, didn't I? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ...... I didn't think there was a hidden power that I didn't even know existed? The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's not a bad idea.
 I've been blown away with all my might, haven't I? The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do it. I've been blown out of a surprise box before, so it's a lot better than that. ......,,,
 I've been thrown out of a surprise box before, so that's a lot better. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure it's not a car that's going to be used for a long time, and that it's not a car that's going to be used for a long time.
 The first time I went to the beach, I was in the middle of the night. The first time I saw him, I thought he was a good man!  I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure you'll be kind to me. I'm a pretty girl, just like I look. ......,,,
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea. The first time I saw her, I thought she was a bit of a dandy!  I'm sure that's what it means to ride the wave. I'd be swallowed up by such a big wave if I were you. ,,,,
 What was the point difference just now? The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and get a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal of things!  I lost the will to resist. I lost the will to resist!  I'm not going to let you get away with it next time!  ,,,,
 I'm not going to let you get away with it, but I'm not going to let you get away with it either. I'm not a fan of the "Greedy", but I'm not a big fan of the "Greedy", either. Greed alone ......,,,
 The only reason you were able to come out of such a crowded field and take the top spot is that you are so competitive,......, and I want to learn to be competitive too!  The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that you are a very good fighter!  ,,,
The best way to get the most out of the game is to win close matches. The best way to get the most out of your time at the beach is to go to the beach!  ,,,,
 I was on the verge of the top, but in the end I got stuck in the mud, and you were on the glamorous top ....... How cruel fate can be. I'm not going to be happy, anyway!  Oh, how sad ......,,,
 I'm not sure what I did, but once I got to the top, I let my guard down. I'm not sure there's anything more pathetic than to be sure of victory and then turn around and lose. Oh, the trauma. ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that even if you score small points, if you keep on accumulating them, they will turn into big points and you will be at the top!  Even if it's a small score, it's still a big score!  I have gained confidence in many ways!  ,,,,
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a small hand, but if you have a good series of hits, you can get to the top. I learned a lot from watching how you play. I'm going to try my best to keep up the good work!  ,,,,
 The big hand is sneaky!  I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a big hand or not, but it's important to have a big hand. ...... I wish I was bigger,......!  ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and get a job, you have to go out there and get a job. I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid,......, but in mahjong, a big hand is more efficient and better. I'm also trying my best to aim for it, but it's not easy,......,,.
 I'm not sure how I'm going to do it. But you shouldn't be discouraged because you're the last one standing. In mahjong, one out of every four players always finishes last!  Well, I did lose a bit in terms of score, but ......,,,
 I lost very badly, didn't I? But you mustn't be discouraged!  I know someone who was defeated, then came back and is now living happily ever after. ......,,,,Mahjong and life is a game after you lose!  ,,
I can't believe that you got the last place just because I went up!  The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good time. It's really tough. ......,,,
 The first time I went to the beach, I was in the middle of the night, and I was so excited to see the sunset. I'm not going to let you down, so please don't be offended. I'm sure you'll be fine.
 I'm capable of coming out on top. I'm not lucky. It's a skill, you know. I'm not a good person!  I'm saying ......, but I'm really happy and I'm grinning all the time. I'm really happy, I'm smiling all the time,,, hehe ......,,.
 I managed to get to the top!  But you were right behind me, and I was so nervous that you might turn the tables on me. If I had gone up even one more time, it would have been no good. I'm glad we got away with it. ......,,,
 We were all fighting for the top spot and everyone had a chance to win, but in the end we lost. (UNTRANSLATED...) Yeah, I don't mind at all,......,,.
 I was kind of hoping that I would win and come out on top, but it didn't work out. I was hoping I could win the match and come out on top, but it didn't work out that way. I'm not sure if it's a good thing, but it was a good fight, wasn't it? ,,,,
 I was the last one to take the top spot. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I understand exactly how you feel. ......,,,
 I was able to take the lead in the reverse direction. I think I was a little bit lucky. I'm sorry, are you angry with me? I'm not offended, so please forgive me. I'm sure a small, pretty girl like me can't have any bad intentions. ......,,
The first time I saw her, I thought she was a good person, but she was a little bit too small for me. The most important thing to remember is that the most important thing to remember is that you are not alone. If so, it's sad,ah......,,,,
 The most important thing in mahjong is technique, but I think the final decisive factor is luck. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to use it. I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I'm sure it's true.
 I'd like to know one thing!  I'm not a fan of the "I'm not a fan of the game, I'm a fan of the game, I'm a fan of the game, I'm a fan of the game. I want to improve my Tsumo too!  I'd like to know what you're doing!  I'm not a fan of the game, but...
 I'll tell you what Kimidori said. I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure you'll be able to find out. I'm not sure what you eat every day that makes you such a strong hiki-ya. Is it hikiwari natto?" I heard that. I'm sorry for the boring comment ......,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not the only one who is getting the best out of your car. I know it's no good if you lose in spirit, but ......,,,
 The first shot is a foul, I think!  The first time you get a one-hit Tsumo, you feel the pain in your chest,......, you have experienced it too, so you know what I mean, right? The first time you do it, it's fine, but if you do it again and again, please don't do it!  I'll tell you what...
 The first time you play, your score gradually decreases,......, and that's really bad. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the person you are talking to. I don't actually do that, though. ......,.
 I'm always ringing a lot of times, but I also think about defending myself in my own way. The most important thing is that you should be able to see the difference between the two. But if you get picked off, it's pointless, isn't it? Being poor at getting picked off is a vain thing. ......,,,,

 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make the most out of your time. Why do you keep on swinging so much? I was a radical in the days of the radicals, and I was a member of the radical school. I was a radical when I was a radical, and I was too much of a radical!  I'm not a radical! 
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing is when you are looking at the same thing in the same way. I'm still half a man in terms of ......, luck, technique and judgment,......, and I'm still weak, I guess. ......,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car.

The most important thing to remember is that the game is not a game of chance, it's a game of chance. The first time I saw a woman in the same room, I thought, 'I'm not going to let that happen again'. ,.
In the game you just played, it was so easy to transfer the points you earned that I wondered if you were handing them out to anyone. Was that all right? If you don't want to win, then next time, please focus on me!  You've been winning so many times, you've lost so many times.
 The best way to get a good score is to use a good scorecard. You should be more careful when choosing your discarded tiles, don't you think? It's too much of a waste!  ,,,
 The spirit of Zentsuppa, the spirit of playing without fear of swinging in any situation, I think it's great!  The most important thing is that you have to be able to get the best out of the game. I'm in love with your super-aggressive attitude!  ,,,
 The first time I saw the film, I was surprised to hear that the film was a big hit. I'm not sure how to reduce the number of transfers. The most important thing is that you should be able to find a good deal of information about the company and its products and services. ...... Sorry, I'm sorry. ,,,,

 The first game of the season was a game of 'The Boss', in which I was the only player to win. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and buy a new pair of jeans and a new pair of jeans and then have them go out and buy a new pair of jeans and a new pair of jeans. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just take a look at the actual situation!  ,,,
Naru is good, isn't it? It's as if everyone's discarded tile becomes your Tsumo, so you have four times the chance of getting a win!  It's not that simple, is it? Anyway, let's ring again and again, and win a lot!  ,,.
 In mahjong, the more you ring, the closer you get to winning. The more you ring, the closer you are to getting an a-ga!  I'm sure you would agree with me, wouldn't you? ,,,,
 The first time I went to the beach, I saw a lot of people. I was almost drowned by the waves, which were too big for me. The game was a lot of fun, but this kind of exciting mahjong isn't bad either. The big hand is the one that you get when you win.
 The best thing about a big hand is that you're happy when you get it, but it's the worst when it's a swing. The best way to get the most out of the game is to play the game with the best players. ,,,,
 The game was a fulfilling one, with everyone giving it their all ....... The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car.

 The game is not good for the players, as it takes too much time and lowers everyone's tenshon. It's nice to be able to save up some money, but ......, next time, try not to lose the game!  ,,,
 I've emailed Kimidori because I heard she has a suggestion. I'm going to expand every round from the next game, so that the game will explode when the game is over. That way, people will be less scared of losing the game, won't they?" That's what he said. The game is not a game, of course. ......,.
Dyeing hands is good, isn't it? The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play mahjong without a lot of help from your friends and family. If you suddenly mulled a Do-Ra and had no other choice but to dye your hand, you might end up with ......,,,,,.

 I also like toi-toys, but I want to kan as well as pon. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's not a bad idea. I like to play Kan rather than Pon!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and.
 I'm not sure I've ever heard of a more beautiful hand. The best way to get a good result is to play with a hand. The best way to do this is to use a hand with a dora. The most important thing to remember is that the hand is not a simple and efficient hand!  ,,,,
 Even with a hand of 1,000 points, you can win if you keep on winning and winning!  I was convinced by the way you played. I'm going to follow your example and start playing more and more games, and I'm going to win more and more games!  ,,,
 I learned a great deal from watching you play. I've learned a lot of things from watching you play. You can make a lot of money when you can make a lot of money in a row. This is the winning method, isn't it? I'm going to put it into practice!  I don't think it's easy to copy it, but ......,,,
 The game you just played, you were up very fast, weren't you? I also tried my best to go up fast, but I couldn't catch up at all. ......, Go up fast and decide who wins and loses quickly. It's an ideal winning pattern. ......,,,
 I'm not sure if I'm a good player or not, but I'm a very good player.

I was surprised to get a Yaku-Man Tsumo. It's not every day you get a yaku-man winning right in front of you. I've had a good experience, you have to think positively about it!  ,,,,,
 I'm not sure if I'm a good person or not, but I'm a good person. Most people would get angry or pissed off, but I'm a tough guy. I'm a tough guy, I can take a yakuman or two!  ,,,,
 I didn't think you could win yakuman. You're pretty good, aren't you? I'm not going to let you get away with it. I'll aim for it in the next game!  ,,,,
 I'm so sorry you got skipped over for yakuman. But I'm a man who can handle adversity, so I'm not discouraged by this. I'm rather burnt up!  ,,,,,
 You see my yakuman? I'm a strong man, I'm a strong man, I'm a strong man, I'm a strong man. I can do this too, when I'm in serious mode!  I'm not a bad guy. You probably think it's just a lucky shot or something. ......,,,,
 I'm not surprised you won at yakuman. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful what you spend your money on!  ,,,,,
 The best way to get a good look at the game is to look at the game itself.

 The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can make a difference in the lives of others. I'm not sure if it's a good thing, but it's not a bad thing. I'm telling you, don't hate me. ,,,,,

I never thought I'd be sent away by you. You did it, didn't you? I don't begrudge you, but I have my own stubbornness. I'll get my revenge in the next game!  You did a great job with the last blow.
 The last blow was amazing. I'm not going to let you get away with it. The first time I played, I was in the middle of the game, and I was in the middle of the game, and I was in the middle of the game. I'm not going to get a chance to fly. ......,,,,
 How many times in a row do you have to do that? I'm not sure how many times I'm going to be able to do that. I couldn't even get my hands on one. I envy you, ......!  I hope I have a good season in the next game. ......,,,
 I'm not sure I've ever seen a game where you were the top. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and buy a new pair of jeans and a new pair of jeans and a new pair of jeans and a new pair of jeans and a new pair of jeans and a new pair of jeans and a new pair of jeans and a new pair of shoes.

The most important thing is that you should be able to find a good deal of information about the company and its products. The game was a tight one, but it was a good one.
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea. I had a chance to win, but in the end, you took all the good parts of the game. I'm not sure what to do with the money, but I'm sure it'll be worth it. I'm proud of you. ,,,,
 I'm disappointed when you're going so well and then you lose the race at the end. The best way to get a good result is to get a good idea of what you're looking for. ...... ,,,,
 I'm sure it must feel good to finally pull me off the top. I feel like an idiot for grinning at the thought of winning. ......,I've had a good dream, goddammit!  ,,,,
 I was so excited to be on top just now, and then I realised you were on top. ...... I feel like I've tasted a glimpse of something terrible. I'm not happy with the result. ......,,,,,
The most important thing to remember is that the best way to win is to play the cheapest moves. I can't do that kind of thing. The most important thing is that you have to get rich quick!  ,,,,
 You can't just go out and get rich quick, you've got to get rich quick. ...... The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're looking for. The best of the best. ,,,,

 I was trying to win with a big shot, and you beat me. ......, but I'm sure the big shot is effective. I'm not going to be the next one to decide!  ,,,,

I'm not going to let you go.
 I'm not sure how you managed to hold on without flying off. I'm not sure how you can do that. I'm not sure if you're a good person or not, but I'm sure you're a good person. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but bottom is bottom. ......,,,,
 I'm on top in a landslide!  I'm the one who's got something going for me, because I'm the one who's going to pull off a dramatic victory like this. I've been thinking about it for a while. I'm sorry I've been such a draw for you, man. I appreciate it!  Hey, man.
 How'd I win? You're gonna love it. I'm not sure if I'm an abomination to you,......, but I'm still overwhelmingly,......, and astonishingly strong. I'm going to try to become a professional mahjong player,......? ,,,
 I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm going to try. I'm not sure you're quite ready to let me get away with it!  I've been meaning to tell you,......, this once!  ,,,
I managed to come out on top, but I was playing scared because the score could have been reversed at any time. After all, I have a flea's heart. If you're too sensitive, you'll have a hard time. ,,,,
 Hmmm... We didn't have the decisive edge, did we? It's a pity, because if we'd had a bit more luck, we might have upset the standings. ...... I'm not sure what to say, but I'm not going to complain about what's done. Let's go next time, next time!  ,,,
 I'm not a big fan of close calls. I'm not good at close calls. I'm not good at close games. ,,,,
 How does it feel to be upstaged by me? You underestimated me, didn't you? That's why I lost. They say a wise man hides his talons, right? No~, I'm so cool!  Hey,,,
 What's the matter, are you depressed because you lost to me? I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I've got a chance to be on top, and I'm going to take it. This isn't the end of the competition. Don't get mad at me!  Don't be mad at me! 
 I'm not going to let you get away with this. I'm not going to be able to do that. When there's a guy with a stupid wig, all you can do is just sit tight. ......,,,,
 Damn!  The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of it!  There is only one person who has a lot of money, and we are plagued by poverty. ......, This is too sad!  The government is trying to change the order of seats in order to correct the disparity!  ,,,
 How can you go up so well at Tsumo? ,(where's my translation?) I'm not sure what to do with the money, but I'm sure it'll be worth it. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
 I'm not going to let you get away with this. The best way to get a good result is to get a good result. I'm not sure if it's a good thing that I'm not a good player, but it's a good thing that I'm a good player.
After riichi, even if you get through with the actual thing, there's nothing you can do if you get tsumoed at the first shot. It's really painful when you get a one-shot Tsumo. The person who gets the Tsumo must feel good, but ......,,,,
 The feeling of despair when you get one shot, you know that too, don't you? If you get that kind of thing repeatedly, you'll hate playing mahjong, won't you? I've had enough of one-shot tsumo!  I know it's pointless to say it, but... ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure you have the best possible use of your money. The best way to get a good result is to get a good score.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure it's not a car that you're going to be driving, and that it's not a car that you're going to be driving. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it.
 You're making so many hands and scoring so many points, but why do you immediately swing back in? Are you the type who only looks at your own hand? If that's the case, you need to look at the scene a bit more, otherwise you're wasting a great win. I'm not a good player.
 The game was pretty much over. You're not a good player. I'm not going to let you down, you know. I'm not going to be a part of this!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play mahjong. The best way to do this is to use a good, clean, and well-designed game plan. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. Don't get carried away!  ,,
 The game just now was centred around you. The game just now was centred on you. Everyone swung in front of you, and the number of points steadily increased ......, I may be suited to a supporting role, but I won't let you get away with this, you know!  ,,,
It's not easy to make a single shot at Ron, is it? It's a brilliant thing to do because you make it happen so many times. I'm not sure if it's just a coincidence, but you have to have a lot of luck, you know. I really think it's a great thing. You're a real piece of work, you know that?
 When you reach, you can't get a one-shot Ron unless you are in a jammed situation where the other players are cutting the winning tile. It means that the timing of the riichi is exquisite. This is a talent. I think it's amazing. You know, I...
 Why are you looking at me like that? Did I do something to you to make you hate me? Or is it because I'm weak that you're concentrating on me? Please, be a little nicer to me. ......,,,,
 I've been dumping all over you. The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who has to pay for the service. The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the difference between the two. You're a wonder, aren't you?
 I'm not sure what to do with it, but it's a good idea. The best way to get a good result is to be careful. If you were a little more careful, you wouldn't have to throw away all those points you've earned.
 You're playing too many games now. If you hadn't made your own Ron-agari, wouldn't you have already gone out of the game? Don't make me give you advice like that for beginners, ....... ,,,
 I'd say, "I'm going to have a go! ". If it were me, I'd be making a big deal out of it. I'd be in a big uproar. The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who has to pay attention to the details of your own life. The game is a good example of this," he said.
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing is when you see the same thing in the same place. I think you're a little ......,or maybe a lot careless, don't you? You don't want to win, do you? The game is a game of play, wait and see, surrender,......, and if you don't think about how to play according to the situation, you'll be in hell for swinging in and out again. ,,

 The game was not so much a game as a competition for points,......, but a fierce battle of that sort. The first time I went to the beach, I saw a lot of people. The best thing is that the game is not a game, it's a game. ,,,
It was a good game, with the four of us giving it our all. The scores were overturned so many times that it didn't matter who won. The game is a great way to get to know each other better, and to get to know each other better. ,,,,
 The game is not so interesting because it takes a lot of time when there are a lot of games going on. The current game took a lot of time too. The game is not very exciting, but it's better than no game. ,,,,
 The number of games that were called off this time was very high. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not a game, it is a game. The most important thing is that you should be able to find the right person to help you. Then I'll sing a song. ......? ,,,,

The hand went up very fast, but were you that lucky with your tiles? Or did he have excellent hands? The game is not a game of chance, it is a game of chance. I'm not sure if I'm a good player or a bad player, but I'm a good player. I envy you, ......,,.
 The game just now, you went up very, very fast. The game was played at a very high speed. I'm not going to let you win, but you were relentless,......, speed is the only way to counter speed. I'm going to go for speed next time, too!  ,,
 MARK12
 Congratulations, you've won. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of equipment that you use for your own personal use. You do it when you have to. I've been watching you again. ,,,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't win a yakuza from me by sheer luck alone. It's impossible without that kind of skill. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. ,,,,
 Congratulations. You've done a brilliant job. But don't get carried away or get upset. You have to put yourself in the mind of the person who was directly hit and rejoice quietly with a humble heart. ......,,,,,
 I'm not supposed to be sent away with a yakuza, but it's ...... humiliating. But people use humiliation as food for further growth. I'm not going to be discouraged by this!  ,,,,
 You see, my Yakuman. I've been beaten up by the SOS group all the time, so I might look weak, but I'm not that weak either, am I? I'm a good player, I'm a good player, I'm a good player!  I'm not a good mahjong player.
 I don't care if the other players win or lose, it doesn't matter to me. I'm not going to be a part of it. The most important thing is that you can't just sit back and watch it happen. ......,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be a little bit more careful. The probability of continuing to pick up the old head tile is quite low. The best way to do it is to make a good decision. ,,,,
It was a sad turn of events, so embarrassing to watch ......, that the game ended without a single win. The next time you play, at least get up at least once. ,,,,
 I'm not sure if it was a little bit unkind of me to let you fly away. But I didn't think it would be that easy,......, so maybe next time I should go a little easier on you,......? ,,,,
 I'm disappointed in you, that you lost so easily. The first time I went to a golf course, I was told that I would have to go to a golf course in the US, but I was not sure if it was a good idea or not. I'm not sure I'm the right person.
 I'm not sure I've ever seen you do that before, but I'm sure you'll be able to do it again. You don't like it when people talk about you like you won by sheer luck? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You've got me beat. For once, you're a complete loser. ......,,,,
 That was a pretty good attack. I can see you're getting better and better. I can see you're getting better and better at it. ,,,,,,
 The best way to get a good result is to get a good number of people to come to you. The first thing you need to do is to be careful about what you say. The best way to win is to always calculate the probabilities and play Mahjong with a clear head!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and
 If the score gap had opened up like that, even I couldn't reverse it. It was a great victory. I'm not sure if you can do that if you really put your mind to it. I'll have to revise my opinion of you upwards, won't I? ,,,
 I saw you look a lot bigger during the game. I'm not sure if you're a good player or not, but I'm sure you're a good player. I'm going to admit defeat this time. I'm not going to accept that this is your true power yet. We'll have to see how you fight in the future. ......,,,
 It was a tough game until the end, wasn't it? I had a chance to win,......, but you got out of it. I'm not sure if I'll be able to win, but I'll have to be more careful in the future. I'll have to be even more vigilant in the future. ......,,,
I was convinced that in a close game like the one we just had, I would be able to take first place because of my superiority, but I still can't believe that I'm behind you. I didn't know you had the competitive spirit to win a close game. ......,,,,
 I can't believe I'm the one who turned the tables on you and took the top spot,......!  I can't accept it, no matter what the reason, whether your power was greater than mine, or whether I was careless,......, I can't accept it!  ,,,
 I was sure I was on top this time, and to have it turned around in the end was such a terrible humiliation!  I was sure I was on top this time, and to get turned around in the end is such a terrible humiliation! 
 Stacking up cheap hands and standing on top. You've been fighting a steady but solid fight. I was a little surprised that you are such a hard-working player. I've heard it said that people who can play steady are tough, so you have to be careful ......,,.
 The best way to get a good score is not to go for the big one, but to play small, steady hands over and over again. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. I admire your technical fighting style. The first time I saw him, he was a big fish.
 I admire your technical fighting style. Your strategy, you got me in a great position. It was a really good attack. Well, as expected. ......,,,,
 The first time I saw the game, I was in the middle of the field, and I was in the middle of the field. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make the most out of your time. The first thing to do is to make the most of your time and energy. The most efficient way to win, really. ,,,,
 The way you lost was terrible. The best thing is that you're not flying,......, but you didn't fly because your luck hasn't given up on you, I think. I'm sorry you didn't make it this time, but....
 I'm sure you'll be able to find your way back to the top. The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when it comes to your own health and wellbeing. I'm not sure if I should beat you while I still can,......? ,,,
I think he's in shock because he got knocked down to the bottom of the list. I'm sorry that you underestimated my ability and let your guard down. I'm not going to take it personally, because it's all a result of a serious competition. ,,,
 I'll turn the tables and you'll fall to the bottom. I'd say it's a foregone conclusion, wouldn't you? Considering the difference in ability between you and me, this is about as good as it gets. If you think you are stronger than me, prove it in the next game. I'll gladly accept your challenge!  ,,
 If I had been hit even once in this game, it would have been an upset, but I managed to get away with it and win. I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get a good deal on the game, but I'm sure you're going to be able to get a good deal on the game. I'm sorry I let you get away with it, but I'm not sure you could have won if I wasn't your opponent. ......,,,
 I'm sorry I let you get away with it. I'd like to say I'm almost there,......, but I let you have hopes of an upset, and then I got away with it. I'd like to say ......, but I gave you a chance to turn the tables on me, and then I got away with it!  I'm a prick, aren't I? ,,
 I'm not a good guy, am I? I still have a lot of training to do. The best way to get a good result is to play the game with a good player. Mahjong is really deep. ......,,,,
 I had a chance to win this game, you had a chance to win this game. I was the only one who could win. I thought I had fought with all my might. We need to analyse the reasons why we lost and make use of them in the next battle. ......,,,,
 How does it feel to be dragged down from the top? It must be very frustrating. But do you realise that you lost because you let your guard down? If you can't understand that, you'll never grow up. ,,,
 Are you angry that I finally turned the tables on you? I'm not angry at you, but that anger shouldn't be directed at me. You're not supposed to point it at me, but at your own naivety and weakness that allowed the upset. ......,,,,
The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good time. I'm not sure what to say now, but I'm not sure what to say now, either.
 The result of the current game is unsatisfactory!  The game was not a proper fight, because the luck was concentrated on one person. The game was not lost because of my mahjong skills. The only thing that matters is that you lost to the luck. I would not have lost if it was only about skill. ...... ,,,
 The best way to get a good result is to play a game of mahjong. The best way to do this is to use the right tools. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. ,,,,
 I was surprised at how well you played in this game, because being able to make such a great win in one game is proof that you have excellent luck ....... The next time you play, you have to be careful. ,,,
 The best thing about the game is that it's a great game, and it's a great game to play. The most important thing to remember is that you can't underestimate the power of your luck. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when you are playing. The most important thing is that you have to be able to get the best out of the game. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to get the best out of your car. The next time you play, you'll have a hard time. ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when you're playing, because you can't be too careful when you're playing. It was a very empty game,......,,,,.
 The most important thing to remember when playing mahjong is that there is nothing more ridiculous than being poor because of a Tsumo. The best way to get a good result in mahjong is to be patient and wait for a chance to reverse the situation. The best way to get a good result is to play mahjong with patience. You have to be patient.
 You don't care about keeping score, do you? You can't just throw away the points you've earned from a hand you've just won. You should keep the points you've earned until the end!  ,,,,
The best way to get the most out of the game is to play the game in the same way you would play mahjong. If you do that, you'll swing again and again and you'll lose all the points you've earned. You can never be too careful in a game. Be careful!  ,,,,
 It's frustrating, but it seems that everyone has cut the winning tile just as you wanted. I thought I could at least read your target tile, but you were one step ahead of me. I admire your skill, and I must reflect on it...
 The game was very well played, with the Ron-ari being so well decided. It was truly a one-man show. I commend you for your vitality. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time I saw the film, I thought it was a good idea. I'm not going to let it go on like this. I'm going to win next time, okay? ,,,
 I'm not going to let you win, but I'm going to let you win, too. The best way to get a good result is to make sure that you have a good chance to win the game. I'm not sure if it's just luck, but ......,,,
 The first shot was "Ron!  The mental shock of being told "Ron!  The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go to the store and buy a new one, you have to go to the store and buy a new one. ......,louis vuitton handbags outlet. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can do this. I'm not convinced that I'd have swung at you so many times if I didn't think so,......, but it's frustrating,......,,,,,
 I've been so wary of you, but I've transferred money to you so many times. I've been so wary of you, but I've made so many transfers to you.
 You are a mystery to me. You've been ron,......, from other houses so many times, but you swing in more than that, I'm not sure if you're good or not,......, I'm not sure if you're good or not,......, I'm not sure if you're not good. ,,,,
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the game is a bit of a challenge for the players. The game was good because you were able to recover with a Ron-agari, but you would have lost a lot if you had not. You should choose your discarded tiles a little more carefully, don't you think? ,,,,
I was watching you during the game, and I thought you were carelessly cutting too many risk tiles. That's why you keep swinging so many times. I don't say anything bad. You should be a little more careful now. ,,,,
 Let me ask you something, can't you deduce the winning tile from the other player's discard? If so, you are ten years too young to play against an expert like me, but ......, you should practice more!  ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be careful when you are playing. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of a game is to play it safe, to avoid a one-shot loss. The first thing you need to do is to take a look at the following: ......,,,,
 I'm not sure how many times you've transferred money to me without asking, you're very service oriented, aren't you? I'm glad you feel that way, but even without your help, I have the skills to win with a bird. I don't need your help. I'm not going to ask you for anything else.
 I'm glad you're happy with the way I'm playing. I've been giving you a lot of advice by e-mail, so maybe this is my way of thanking you? You don't have to be so careful. ......,,,,
 You squeal a lot, don't you? The most important thing to remember is that you are not alone in your decision-making process. The only thing that matters is the quality of the music.
 The most important thing is that you should be able to see the difference between the two. I'm not going to stop you. But the more you expose your hand by ringing, the harder it will be for you to win. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player's own personal style, but rather about the player's own personal style. The most important thing is to make sure that you are not a victim of the game. ,,,
 The current game is very rough, isn't it? The game was like this: heaven if you win, hell if you lose. ...... The game was a lot rougher than it sounds, but it was a lot of fun.
It's a given, but the happiness you feel when you get a big hand is proportional to the score. When a big move is made in a row, it's so much fun that even a calm and collected person like me almost loses my mind. It's like the game we're playing now: ......,,,,
 The game was a fierce battle of upsets after upsets,...... and fluctuating scores and rankings. The winner of such a game is the real strongman. The game was a test of my strength as a mahjong player. Well, I don't need to be tested,......,,.
 Mahjong is only interesting if the four of you are all strong. The first thing that comes to mind is that the game is a good one. The game was a good one, and I'm looking forward to playing with the current members for a while longer, to have some friendly competition. ,,,
 The only time I'm happy to see a hand go down is when I'm the only one with tenpai. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a lot of people in the same room, but I think I'd be more happy if I won by myself, even if it's only 1000 points, than if I got a no-ten point penalty. It's illogical, but ......,,,,
 I think that going out is a waste of time, especially when there are four no-ten players. Especially when four players are playing no-ten, it's the worst. It's also irritating to see people swinging into obvious riichi or making rubbish hands in 4th place, but even so it's better than a no-go. ......,,,,
 The tendency is for the dyed-in-the-wool players to collect tiles of the same kind for the time being, leave the handmade ones to chance, and completely discard the tiles of a different kind ....... The most important thing to remember is that the best way to play Mahjong is to make a good hand and to read each other's moves. The best and worst thing is that you can't just go to ......,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the more you stick to a dyed hand, the harder it will be to win, and the more likely you are to get hit by tiles of a type you haven't collected yet. I think it's risky in many ways. ......,,,,
 The toy is certainly a threat when it comes to dora, but what else is there to use it for? (robot disappoints again),,,
The same tiles are not only to be played with, it is to deny the pleasure of handmade games.

 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful what you spend your money on. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go for the easy way out, you have to go for the easy way in. I'm convinced of that, seeing the way you play. ,,,
 If you are aiming for a high score and waiting for a good Tsumo, and someone else gets away, you will only lose money. But if you get away with it, even if it's cheap, you'll get more points. The best way to get a good score is to make the best of the situation. The first thing to do is to make sure that you have the right tools and the right people to help you.
 The first thing that comes to mind is how fast you made your handmade. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not, but it's a good thing. I'm sure I could have won faster if I really wanted to, but it's not very nice to get mad and compete with each other. ......,,,,
 You must have had a very good tile set up. The best way to get a good result is to play the game with the best tiles. I'm surprised at how lucky you are. A little bit. ......,,,,
 MARK13
 Congratulations on your Yaku-Man Tsumo!  I'm quite shocked that you got all the points, but I have to congratulate you. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I have to congratulate him!  ,,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just take a few minutes of your time and just sit back and relax. I don't want to experience this kind of shock anymore. ......,,,,
 Congratulations!  It's not often you get to win a yakuman, it's a great experience. I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get a good result!  I want you to share with me just one tenth of your eye-catching, enchanting aura, ......,.
 Why me? Why me? There were two other potential victims. And, of all people, to be sent away with a yakuman,...... is the ultimate losing pattern, isn't it? It's sad. ......,,,,
How did you like my yakuza? I'm not surprised, am I? I'm not a good actor, I'm not a good actor. I'm not often the star of the show, you know!  I'm so happy!  I'm so happy! 
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get a good result is to be a good player. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play with your friends and family, you can't just go out and play with your friends and family, you can't just go out and play with your friends and family. I'm not sure if I'd be able to do it myself, but I'd be so happy that I'd probably start dancing. ,,,,

 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing is when you see the same thing in the same place. The best way to do this is to use the same method as the one used by the other. I'm not sure, but it's a rare case. Don't be discouraged by such things. If you continue as usual, you'll get back on top. Don't worry!  Don't,,,,,don't.
 I never thought I'd let you fly away, I never thought I'd let you fly away. I'm sorry for giving you a hard time, though I didn't mean to. I'm really sorry!  ,,,,
 I'm sorry you had to go through that. I know what it's like to be sent away. I'm really sorry. ......, but you're not so weak that you'd be discouraged by something like that, are you? I'm sure you'll strike back in the next game!  ,,,,
 I had a bad feeling about this. I had a bad feeling about it,......, like a shiver down my neck,......, if I had played more carefully then, at least you wouldn't have sent me away,......,,,,
 I'm not sure if you're the type of person who needs a thorough thrashing to settle a dispute. I'm not the type of person who likes to beat up people like me, so I have to watch out for people like you. ......,,,,
 I'm not sure what you're talking about. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful. I sometimes think, "Oh, it's coming," but it's not as good as the BAKAZUKI you just saw. ......,,,
I'm not sure I'd be able to turn it around if we were trailing that far behind. If I were a man of fighting spirit, the more the score gap opens up, the more I burn, but I'm not. ......, I'm just stunned," he said. ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and get a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a good deal on a bad basis. I'm not sure if I should be looking at them, but when they're that far behind, ......,,,, I'm not sure I should be looking at them.
 To tell you the truth, it's frustrating. I had a chance to win, but you took all the good parts of the game away from me. ......, Well, I guess that's how strong you are, but I'm not ready to give up. ......,,,, I'm not ready to give up.
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a new game, but it's a good idea to have a new game. I could have won the top spot if my luck had come my way one more time, but in the end, I lost to your luck. ......,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and I can't outplay you. I'm not sure if it's possible for me to outwit you...,...? ,,,
 I was so happy to get the top spot, but to let me down at the last minute, you're a bad person too. I'm sorry I got turned around, because this is a serious game. ......,,,,
 Hmm. I thought this game was going to be a great chance for me to get the spotlight, but I didn't expect you to take the lead in the end. I was beaten,......, I guess I can't be the star after all,......,,,,.
 The first thing to do is to make sure that you are not the only one who can do it. The best way to win is to be very steady, isn't it? I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it. I don't know if I can do it. ......,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to be desperate to make a big move, you just have to make sure you make a cheap move, accumulate points and get to the top. The best way to get the top is to make sure that you have the cheapest moves and accumulate points, without trying too hard to play big moves. The best way to do this is to play the game with a good hand, and to play the game with a good hand, and to play the game with a good hand.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to win is to play a big hand, earn some points, and then run away with it by consolidating your guard. It's a very good way to win, isn't it? If I won every time with this pattern, I'd be too strong and people wouldn't like me. ......,,,,
I tried my best to turn things around, but in the end, I got away. I was so impressed with the power of a big hand that just a little bit up in the air can get away with it. I admire your strength. ,,,,
 The result of the game was disappointing, wasn't it? But since you only finished last and didn't get skipped, you must consider it lucky for now. You shouldn't get depressed over something like this!  ,,,,
 I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it again. You were almost blown away, weren't you? The best way to do this is to get a good, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean. I'm sure that stubbornness will become more of a threat the longer the fight goes on. ......,,
 I'm going to launch a counterattack, knock you off your perch. I've been secretly planning this for a while now, and it's all worked out. I'm not sure if I've made my presence felt a bit, with the way I'm fighting now. ,,,,
 The first time you do this, you'll be in a position to win the race. I'm not mad at you, though, because it's a game, right? ,,,,
 I'm not mad at you. I'm not sure if this is my real power or not. The first time I went to a golf club, I was in the middle of the road, and I was in the middle of the road, and I was in the middle of the road. The first time I saw him, I thought, "What the hell is this?
 The first time I went to a golf club, I was in the middle of a tightrope walk, but somehow I managed to hold on to the top spot. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. I'm glad my luck was just a little bit better than yours. ,,,,
 The first time I played in the tournament, I was in the top three, but I didn't make the most of it. ...... If you can't win a close game, you're probably not good enough. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm going to have to get more experience and hone my skills. ...... ,,,
 The game was so volatile that I thought I could win if I played well, but I guess I wasn't so naive. I guess I'm not a very good player after all. ......,,,,
I was happy because I thought I had won, but then I was disappointed when they turned it over at the end. It's really hard to lose in reverse. I know exactly how you feel right now. ...... Sorry. Sorry. ,,,,,
 I was allowed to take the top spot!  I'm sorry for what I did to you, but if I don't show my stuff once in a while, I'll just be forgotten more and more. ...... ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get a good deal is to be the best you can be. The most important thing to remember is that you can't have a good time, you can't have a bad time, and you can't have a good time. ,,,,
 The best way to get a good result in mahjong is to play with a lot of luck. The most important thing to remember is that you can't win against a fool like that, no matter how good your technique is. I wish I could get a lucky break as big as that. ......,,,,
 The game earlier, it seems that you were in good form with your Tsumo. The best way to do this is to use the best of the best. The best way to get the best out of your car is to buy a car that has a good price tag. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be a good player. How can I improve my Tsumo? The best way to do it is to be a good player.
 The best way is to draw the right tiles one after the other, like you did just now. The best way to get a good score is to get a good number of good tiles, like you did just now. ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to be a good driver. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure that it is not a car that will not be used for long periods of time.
 I'm not going to be able to do it again and again, how strong are you? I'm not a fan of the game!  The game is a game of violence. I'm sad that he's a weak hiki. ......,,
The game was played with an emphasis on defence, so as not to swing the ball, but it was pointless. The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when you're playing. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see a woman in the street, you know she's going to be there.
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play with the same hand. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be a good player. The only way to win is to attack and win, isn't it? That's the hardest thing to do. ......,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be a good player. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play with the same hand. The game is a very good one. ,,,
 I'm not sure how many times you swung and didn't seem to move at all, but you're a very bold mahjong player. I'm not sure if you're thinking of defending yourself. I'm sure you're not thinking about defending yourself, but if you swung in like that, you're wasting the points you earned with Tsumo Agari, aren't you? I don't know.
 How can you make a Ron-agari so easily? It looks easy, but maybe you're struggling. ......,What's the difference between you and me? ,,,,
 The game seems to have been going your way. The game was going the way you wanted it to go. The game was going well. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the player who is the most successful is the one who has the best chance to win the game. The first shot Ron is not possible without luck, timing and many other conditions, but how sharp a read you have to make that decision again and again. I respect you a bit, don't you? ,,.
 I heard that good mahjong players are good at setting traps in the discarded tiles and pulling out the right tiles at the first shot. I want to make use of that kind of thing too, and make a cool one-shot Ron ......,,,.
It was a rather unlucky game. Why did I transfer so much to you? I'm not sure if you've been targeted by me? I'm not sure, but there's no merit in them targeting me. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.
 I've been a sucker for you this whole time, haven't I? I'm not sure why your winning tiles always come to me, though. There are so many things in mahjong that can't be explained by logic, ......,,,.
 You discarded the risk tiles quite easily, but that's a bit reckless, isn't it? (Silly computer denies my my elephant) ,,,
 The first time I played, I was in the middle of a game, and I was in the middle of a game. You should play a little more carefully, shouldn't you? The first time I saw you play, I thought you were a bit of a pussy, but I didn't think you were a pussy," he said.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be a good sport. The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to be a good sport. I'm sure you have the mental strength to not give up no matter how hard you swing, but ......,,, you know, you've got to be strong.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of the game is to be a good player. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, it's about the player. The most important thing to remember is that you are not afraid of swinging in ......, I can't imitate you. I'm not a fan of that.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of a game is to be a good player. The best way to do this is to use the same kind of handbag as the one you've got on your wrist.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your car is to make sure that it is not a car that will be used for a long time. The most important thing is to keep your eyes on the road ahead. ,,,
You've made me a lot of money. I have to thank you for your kindness, not your recklessness ....... I hope you can keep up the good work in the next round. ,,,,
 I am very grateful to you for your kindness to me. I'm sure we'll be good friends. ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of a game is to play it as it is, and to do so in a way that is not too aggressive. The most important thing to remember is that the hand is not a handmade one, it is a handmade one.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be careful about what you spend. If you know that and are actively ringing, you have a lot of confidence. ......,,,,
 The game was a very rough one, with all the high winning moves. It was a very rough game. The game was very rough. I was a bit hot too. ,,,
 When I made a big hand, I felt like I'd done it!  I'm not sure if it's the same for me, but it's a good feeling. The same way, when you swing a big one, the feeling of pleasure spreads gradually,....... Am I the only one who thinks so? ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to use it. I think that's exactly how it was. The best way to get a good score is to play with a good player. ,,,
 The game was a fierce one, as if the players were fighting. The game was a wild one, like, "If I get a point, I'll take it back immediately! " The game was wild, like that. The tense fights are fun, but you have to concentrate all the time, so your nerves get tired...
When you can't make a tenpai and the game goes to Null Round, you feel really bad, don't you? It's proof that you don't have any luck at all. The only time I'm happy with a Null Round is when someone makes a high riichi and I escape from a swinging pin. ......,,,,
 The game was very much a null game, wasn't it? The game was a lot of nulls, it took a lot of time and the atmosphere was heavy, so I tried to avoid it. ......, I didn't have good tiles and I didn't have good Tsumo, so it was hard to get up, how was your game? ,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your hand is to be careful when you are playing. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your game is to be the best at what you do. The same kind of tiles in the same hand can be used in the same way.
 The best way to do this is to use the same kind of tiles in your hand. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of a hand is to make sure it is the right kind of hand. The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the world. ,,,
 The best way to do this is to use the same kind of hand, but with a different hand. The other day, I was looking at you, and I thought you were going to force me to make toi-toys. I think your persistence is, in a way, amazing. ,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play mahjong without thinking about what kind of hand you're going to make. The best way to do this is to use a hand with a hand that is not a hand with a hand, but a hand with a hand with a hand. I'm not a fan of the game, but I'm not a fan of the game. ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get a good score is to get a lot of hits. The word "quantity over quality" may be a winning theory in mahjong. I learnt that from the way you play. ,,,,
 To win at mahjong, you have to make a cheap hand, quickly, and make a lot of chan-chan. It sounds easy when you put it into words, but it's surprisingly difficult to do. You have the technique to do it so easily. I feel like I want to be an apprentice!  I feel like I want to be your apprentice. I'd like to be your apprentice.
I was surprised at how fast you played. I was surprised at the speed of your hand, mahjong-wise of course. The best way to get a good result is to play with a good hand. ,,,,,
 You can't win that fast unless both your tiles and your hands are in good shape. You've got a lot of luck, don't you? The best way to get a good result is to play the game with a good hand. If you say it's luck, can you go as fast next time? ,,
 MARK14
 I'm not sure I can do it. You're amazing. ......,,,,,,,,,
 I'm not sure how you can get a Yaku-Man from me, that's terrible ......, but it's a game too, so there's nothing you can do about it. ,,,,,,,
 You've won a yakuman, that's amazing. Congratulations. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. I respect you...,... ,,,,,,
 I didn't expect to win a yaku-man. I'm a little disappointed. ,,,,,,,
 I was surprised myself that I could get yakuman. I'm not a good player, but it's just a lucky shot. It's not my power. ......,,,,,,
 Yakuman is amazing. And I think the person who got yakuman is amazing too. I think it's hard for me to do it. ......,,,,,,,
 Nigashi Man-suwan is very rare, isn't it? I don't know why it is called Man-suki, but ......,,,,,,,
 I was unlucky that I couldn't get out even once. I don't know how it happened, but I don't know. I just think so somehow...,...,,,,,,
 I never thought I'd skip you,......, I didn't do it on purpose!  I'm sorry, anyway,......, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!  ,,,,
 I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm not going to let that happen. You're much stronger than I am. Don't be discouraged. ......,,,,,,,
 I've been blown away. I'm still out of practice. But if you're going to send me away, that's okay too. ......,,,,,,
 I'm not sure I'll be able to do it. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to play with a player who's not a good mahjong player, or a player who's a good mahjong player, or a player who's a good mahjong player. ......,,,,,,,,
I was surprised that you could play so many games in a row. The game was a great success. You're really strong, ......,,,, you are.
 I'm amazed that you can score so many points by yourself. You've got a great score, but you're also amazing......,,,,,,,
 I think you scored too many points by yourself. I didn't catch up with you at all. It's a bit sad. ......,,,,,,,
 You're so strong to win in the end after such a long race. ,,,,,,,,
 I tried my best not to lose, but I couldn't win. I'm so weak. ......,,,,,,,
 I thought I could win,......, but this time I thought I could win,......,sad,......,,,,,,,
 I thought I was in first place, and then you turned the tables on me,......, but that's okay. You won. ......,,,,,,
 It's a very nice way to win, to accumulate and take first place. ......,,,,,,,,
 I'm not sure if it's cheap, but if you get a lot of rises, you can get to first place. I hope you have learned a lot from watching you win. ......,,,,,,,
 I thought it was a good way to win, to get a high hand and run away with it. You're so smart. ......,,,,,,,
 I thought it was a good way to win. Thanks for teaching me how to win efficiently. ......,,,,,,,
 I lost badly, didn't I? But even if you lose this time, there's always the next time, so don't be discouraged. You just have to win the next time. ......,,,,,,
 We lost a lot, didn't we? But there's no way we can keep losing this badly, so let's look to the next time and ......,s look on the bright side. ,,,,,,
 Did you come last because I went up? Did I cause you trouble? ......,I'm sorry. ......,,,,,,,
 Are you angry that I turned the tables on you? That's why you came last, of course. ......,I'm sorry. ......,,,,,,
I'm so happy to win first place. It gives me a bit more confidence in myself,......, and I could have turned it around, but thank you for letting me win. ,,,,,,
 I was so close to getting upset, but I managed to win. I'm so happy. I'm glad you're happy with me. ...... ,,,,,,
 I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it again, but I'm going to try. I'll have to try harder next time!  ,,,,,,
 If I could have gone up one more time, I would have had a chance to win,......,I wish I could have won,......,,,,,,,
 Did you see that? I got the upset top. I'm sorry I dropped you from the top, only ......,,,,,,
 I still can't believe I'm number one in an upset. And I can't believe I've overtaken you,......, what if it's just a dream,......,,,,,,
 I can't believe that one person can have all the happiness and everyone else is in shambles,......, how can such injustice be allowed to happen? It's too much......,,,,,,
 I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm not sure what to make of it either. I was a little frustrated because I couldn't do anything. I wish I could get such great luck too. ......,,,,
 I'm not sure if it's a good time to play mahjong, but I'm sure it's a lot of fun. I wish I could do it again and again with a smile on my face like you. ......,,,,,,
 I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to do it again, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it. I'm so jealous of you. I'm not sure if it's because I'm so timid,......,,,,,,
 I get nervous when someone says Ippatsu Tsumo,......, people who repeatedly make Ippatsu Tsumo are too strong and scary,......,,,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out there and play. I'm shocked even if it happens once, but if they do it again and again, I'm going to cry. ......,,,,,
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to do it. I feel like crying when I get tsumoed repeatedly,......, because I get points even though I didn't do anything,......,,,,,,
I was getting tsumoed, tsumoed, tsumoed,...... and I kept getting more and more points,...... and it was a sad end,....... ,,,,,,
 Why do you throw away tiles recklessly? If you want to win, don't swing anymore,......, even though it looked like you were going to win,......,,,,,,,
 Your way of playing is always competitive. That's fine if you want to win. But you have to think about your defence too, otherwise you won't win. ......,,,,,,
 How can you get up to the RON so easily? The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who has to pay for the service. I'm envious of you, because I can't get up easily. ......,,,,,
 I was scared of you during the game. I felt like no matter what I cut, I would get Ron,......, I know you're doing well, but it would be nice if you could cut back a little on the Ron,......,,,,,
 How can you do it so many times when it's so hard to do it in one shot? You can read people's minds? I'm not sure, but I'm very impressed. I admire you. ......,,,,,
 I'm very shocked when I get one shot at a Ron, and it costs me a lot of points, so I'd prefer not to have one shot at a Ron. ......,,,,,,
 The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see the same thing, you will be surprised. I was never going to transfer any money at all,......, but maybe you were the one who was after me? ,,,,,
 The first time I played, I was in the middle of a game, and I didn't know why I had swung at you so hard. I'm not sure why I swung at you so hard in the game earlier. I wonder if I'm under some kind of spell,......? ,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to use it. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your car is to make sure that you are not going to be able to get a car that will not be able to get a car that will not be able to get a car.
 I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to do. The most important thing to remember is that you can't afford to lose your job, so you need to think about how you're going to protect yourself. ......,,,,,
The way you hit, you don't seem to think about the risk of swinging in at all. You are not reckless at all,......,,,,,,.
 The most important thing to remember is that you are not a fool if you don't think about it. The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to take a chance...,,,,,
 I think it's not good to swing into the reach at once. I'm also nervous when I see it,......, so right after riichi, you should cut all the cheap tiles,......,,,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure that it is not a waste of time and money. I think it's too much damage. ......,,,,
 I was happy that you helped me in the game earlier,......, I'm sure it was very considerate of you. Thank you. ,,,,,,
 I'm very happy that you helped me. It helped me a lot. The most important thing is that you are not only a good person, but you are also a good person. Or is it ......,,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure that you have a good credit score. I'm too embarrassed,......, you think nothing of ringing like that? ,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to use your own money. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go out and play with the same tiles. I'm not a fan of the "I'm not a fan of the game" approach, but I'm not a fan of the "I'm not a fan of the game" approach. Sometimes I give up. ......,,
 I'm very tired of all the high hands,......, If you play mahjong, it might be easier to win a lot of high hands, but it's too much for me,......,,,,,
 I'm afraid of big hands because I have a stronger image of swinging in than going up,......,you have to have a stronger mindset to survive,......,,,,,
 The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the world. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a good time, but it's a good idea to have a good time. ......,,,,,
I was very nervous when I played this game because I could feel how serious everyone was about the game. I was also quite serious about the game, did you understand? ,,,,,
 The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your game is to play the best game you can. If I had a little more luck, I could have won. ......, So I don't like it when the game goes to Null Round. ......,,,,
 When there are a lot of nullified games and it takes a long time, don't you start to feel sleepy? Is it just me? I think you have to play the game with more tension. ......,,,,,,
 You can easily see who is aiming for Hongitsu, Chinitsu and dyed hands, can't you? It's obvious if you look at the field,......, so why are there so many people aiming for it? It's a mystery,......,,,.
 The game is a good way to learn how to play the game. I don't like dyed hands, but I can understand your feelings. I'm not a fan of dyeing hands, but I can see how you feel about it.
 I think if you use pon, you can easily get toe-to-toe, but I don't know if it's really that easy. ......, If it were really that easy, I would try to get toe-to-toe all the time. ......,,,,
 If you have two or three dora in your hand, it would be interesting to aim for toi-toys. But, if you don't have dora in your hand, then it's not very appealing. ......,,,,,
 It's good if you can get a win even if it's cheap. The best way to do this is to use a single shot. The game is not a game. The most important thing to remember is that the game is not about the player, but about the game itself. Thank you. ......,,,,,
 Cheap hands are easy to win, so it's easy to make a series of wins. The most important thing to remember is that you have to be careful when you are playing, because you never know what you might get. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's not a bad idea. ,,,
 The speed of your handmade, the speed at which you can move was unbelievably fast. I can't keep up with you,......, please slow down a bit more,......,,,,
The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time I saw a woman in a bikini, I thought to myself, 'I've never seen her like that before'. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'd like you to share a little bit of your luck with me. If you do, you'll be a little stronger. ......,,,,
